Libyas Oil Production Bounces Back Following Pipeline Repairs.html,"Libya’s crude oil production rose to 900,000 bpd from 700,000 bpd after the completion of repair work on a pipeline, the country’s oil ministry said, as quoted by Bloomberg. The pipeline that was being repaired links two oil fields to the Es Sider export terminal. Its shutdown for repairs took 200,000 bpd offline, which coincided with field outages caused by blockades that shaved off more barrels from Libya’s total. Before the outages and the pipeline shutdown, Libya was producing between 1.25 and 1.3 million bpd, but the latest events brought this down to less than 800,000 bpd temporarily.
 More outages are not out of the question, however. Libya’s oil infrastructure has suffered years of neglect, and the field shutdown for the pipeline repairs is unlikely to be the last one. As the chairman of the National Oil Corporation said earlier this month, the country’s oil infrastructure has been a casualty of years of illegal closures and financial problems that are yet to be solved. In addition to more repairs likely to affect production, the dispute between the government and the Petroleum Facilities Guard is still not settled, suggesting that the field outages may continue. The PFG shut in production from four fields in December, including Libya’s top producer, El Sharara, which has the capacity to produce 300,000 bpd. The reason for the blockade is, once again, delays in salary payments, according to the PFG, which, as the name suggests, is supposed to be guarding oil facilities. During Libya’s civil war, however, the PFG evolved into yet another paramilitary group in the conflict-torn country.
 Despite the complex political and social situation, the NOC has been putting a lot of effort into boosting oil production, especially while Libya is exempt from the OPEC+ production cuts. Plans are to increase the total to 1.4 million bpd, although with all the disruptions, it will likely take longer than the NOC hopes.",Pos
Tighter Wastewater Regulation Becomes Headache For Shale Drillers.html,"Dealing with the US shale industry’s produced water is increasingly controversial for operators, a new Rystad Energy report reveals. Even though total produced volumes are projected to hit new record highs in the coming years, treated water is expected to be comparatively lower than in the past, despite water disposal practices increasing oilfield seismic activity, with earthquakes nearly doubling in West Texas alone in 2021. Future growth in US shale activity is tied with an inevitable increase in produced water, as hydraulic fracturing for hydrocarbon production leads to greater volumes of water. Therefore, as elevated oil prices drive shale activity in major basins, produced water levels in US onshore oilfields are set to return to the all-time-high level of 22.9 billion barrels in 2022, an 8% rise from 2021. New records are anticipated from 2023 at 23 billion barrels, further growing to 23.8 billion barrels in 2026. Fracking activity alone will rise 7% in 2022. When the water is treated, saltwater disposal (SWD) through underground injection which has been linked to greater earthquake activity is avoided. Looking at absolute numbers, the amount of treated water rose to 1.9 billion barrels in 2021, up from 1.6 billion in 2020, and is set to fluctuate between 2 and 2.2 billion barrels through 2026. However, what the expected rise in the absolute volume of treated water does not show is the amount of untreated water leftover, which is in line to reach an all-time high of 20.9 billion barrels in 2022 and then to steadily grow to 21.6 billion barrels in 2026. In percentage terms, treated volumes reached their highest level in 2018 and 2019, representing 9.4% and 9.6% of total produced water volumes, respectively. Rystad Energy’s outlook through 2026 shows that such levels will not be met again. In 2020, the percentage of treated water fell to 7.6%. In 2021, it reached 8.9%, and between 2022 and 2026 it is set to fluctuate between 8.7% and 9.2%. The trend is cause for concern, especially in the light of the boom in West Texas’ earthquake activity that Rystad Energy’s analysis of seismic data reveals. Earthquakes in West Texas of more than 2.0 magnitude almost doubled in 2021, from 1,110 to 1,929. As a result of the pressure on E&Ps to demonstrate greater ESG responsibility, the need to treat and recycle water is more prominent than ever. 
 Coupled with declining freshwater availability in some of the shale basins in the US, an alternative to using freshwater in the fracking process is much sought after. “The oilfield water market is poised for a very interesting 2022. M&A activity, regulatory responses to induced seismicity, and rising produced water volumes across the US lower 48 states have all set the stage in 2021 for what will certainly be the most dynamic market conditions in a growing oilfield segment,” says Ryan Hassler, senior analyst with Rystad Energy. Despite the buzz of activity and investment in the water recycling segment across much of the Permian and the DJ Basin, disposal volumes are still expected to increase year-over-year through 2026. Disposed water volumes are expected to rise from 11.5 billion barrels in 2021 to 13.4 billion barrels by 2026. In most instances, SWD capacity remains abundant, with almost no bottlenecks on a basin-wide level. However, localized constraints are evident in specific areas such as Northern Culberson County or Howard and Midland counties. Clusters of SWD wells with extreme volume and pressure utilization exist in these regions, consequently seeing an exponential rise in seismic activity. In 2021, seismic activity of magnitude 2.0 or greater increased by 74% in West Texas compared with 2020 levels, with Culberson County alone experiencing an increase of 112%. Martin, Howard and Midland counties have also observed similar increases in seismic activity. In response to such high disposal activity, the Texas Railroad Commission (RRC) has enforced unprecedented SWD restrictions in recent months. The first response came in September and October 2021, when the RRC identified two Seismic Response Areas (SRAs), namely the Gardendale SRA and the Northern Culberson-Reeves SRA. These regions saw SWD capacity reductions, stringent reporting guidelines, and a moratorium on all new SWD permitting for at least one year. Doubling down on the effort, the RRC recently ordered the suspension of all disposal well permits injecting produced water into deep injection wells below the top of the Strawn Formation, and especially the Ellenburger formation in the Gardendale SRA. The action applies to 33 deep disposal wells operated by 14 operators, with a total permitted disposal capacity of nearly one million barrels. The order took effect as of December 31, 2021. Of the 33 wells, 25 are currently active, two are inactive and six have been permitted but are awaiting drilling services. Of the 14 operators, ConocoPhillips experiences the largest loss of disposal capacity, with a total of 186,000 barrels shuttered, followed by Rattler Midstream at 150,000 barrels and Wasser Operating and Fasken Oil and Ranch each with a loss of 120,000 barrels of permitted disposal capacity. SWD operators in the Northern Culberson-Reeves SRA must now wait patiently to understand the full regulatory response that may befall them after watching the fate of their peers in the Gardendale SRA.
 Related: Fossil Fuel Financing Under Pressure As Wall Street Caves To ESG Demands In addition to the two SRAs, the RRC has identified three additional Seismic Investigation Regions (SIRs), which it deems are at high risk of getting upgraded to SRA status, resulting in effective capacity reductions, moratoriums on all new permits, and potential suspensions like in the Gardendale. All told, the Texas RRC has reduced the SWD capacity within the SRAs by half under the current guidelines. Operators and water midstreams including ConocoPhillips, Rattler Midstream, NGL Energy Partners, Coterra Energy and Chevron stand to lose upwards of 50% of their disposal capacity in key acreage positions. Although yearly growth in the recycled water market is projected to rise, produced water is forecast to grow at nearly the same pace, meaning disposal remains an essential component of the process. Given the current regulatory environment and the potential to enact even more restrictive measures, the cost of disposing of a barrel of water in the Permian Basin will likely only increase. Options exist outside of treatment, such as piping longer distances to under-utilized SWD wells in adjacent acreage or even further distances outside the basin into the central platform where minimal seismic risk exists. Of course, the cost dictates the adoption of such solutions. The best way to hedge against regulation and cost is to invest now in the recycling network needed to handle future barrels of water. In the most recent round of sustainability reporting, many operators have been more transparent about their water stewardship, reporting standardized metrics for the investment community to analyze. In 2022, there are likely to be even more frameworks established to calculate ESG scores and benchmark operators on their water management practices, much like on emissions. Investments need to be made today to get ahead of the curve and position well for 2022.",Neg
Oil Boom In South America Boosts FPSO Demand.html,"The market for floating production, storage, and offloading (FPSO) units almost brushed off the pandemic’s effect in 2021 and is likely to continue apace in 2022, with 10 new awards expected, according to a Rystad Energy report. Two lease contracts were awarded in the fourth quarter of 2021, bringing the total for the year to 10 – up from just three in 2020 – a strong rebound for the FPSO market. Demand for FPSO units in Brazil was a significant contributing factor that drove 2021 growth, with seven of last year’s 10 contract awards being Brazilian projects. The South American nation is expected to continue driving global awards in 2022, with an additional three FPSOs expected. Not only is Brazil delivering more awards, but the Brazilian projects are expected to be the largest in terms of production capability. For instance, the unit bound for P-80 will become the ninth in the Buzios area. It will have an oil processing capacity of around 225,000 barrels per day (bpd) and a gas processing capacity of about 12 million cubic meters per day, which is the same size as the FPSO Almirante Tamandare awarded in early 2021. In 2022, fellow South American player Guyana is expected to contribute one FPSO to the global total, with the UK adding two projects. Angola, Australia, China, and Malaysia are forecast to each award one new FPSO contract this year. “With around 30 FPSO units under construction or queued up for construction, and another 10 expected to be awarded over the next 12 months, the market is set to build on its recent success. However, as witnessed in many other facets of the global economy in recent months, supply chain concerns linger and will test the market’s ability to take in new contracts without uncontrollable cost overruns and delays,” says Zhenying Wu, a senior analyst with Rystad Energy. 
 The FPSO market saw a strong finish to 2021, with two lease-and-operate contracts, two front-end engineering and design (FEED) contracts and one contract extension awarded in the fourth quarter. Related: The Lone Star State May Host The World’s Next Big Hydrogen Hub In Brazil, Yinson has been awarded two letters of intent (LOI) from Petrobras to supply the Integrado Parque das Baleias (IPB) FPSO and for operation and maintenance services under a lease-and-operate agreement lasting 22 years and six months from the day of final acceptance. The FPSO will be deployed at the Jubarte field in the North Campos basin and is scheduled to start production in late 2024. Enauta Energia issued Yinson another LOI to provide, operate and maintain an FPSO at the Atlanta field in the Santos basin in Brazil. The job covers the adaptation of FPSO OSX-2 by Yinson through a turnkey engineering, procurement, construction and installation (EPCI) contract, with warranty and operations and maintenance for 24 months. The FPSO acquisition and adaptation cost will be around $505 million. Yinson has the option to purchase a unit linked to funding. If the call option is exercised, it will be linked to charter, operation and maintenance contracts for 15 years, which may be extended for another five years, totaling $2 billion for the 20 years. The contract is Yinson’s third project award in Brazil and is subject to a final investment decision during the first quarter of 2022. Elsewhere in South America, ExxonMobil awarded SBM Offshore an FPSO FEED contract for the deepwater Yellowtail development in the Stabroek block off the coast of Guyana. The FPSO will be designed to have an oil-processing capacity of 250,000 bpd, a gas-processing capacity of 450 million cubic feet per day and storage of up to 2 million barrels. When finished, the FPSO will be the company's largest producing unit ever built.
 ExxonMobil is currently producing from Stabroek via the Liza Destiny FPSO. The Liza Unity FPSO arrived in Guyanese waters on 26 October, and ExxonMobil expects both units to produce this year. When the Prosperity and Yellowtail projects come online in 2024 and 2025, respectively, ExxonMobil will have a total processing capacity of more than 800,000 bpd in Guyana. In Nigeria, BW Offshore secured a lease extension for the FPSO Sendje Berge, operating for Addax Petroleum Exploration (Nigeria) Ltd, that will run through to the fourth quarter of 2022. In Norway, Aker Solutions received an LOI for a FEED contract from Equinor to supply an FPSO to be employed at the Wisting field in the Norwegian sector of the Barents Sea. The scope of the FEED is to provide front-end engineering design for a circular FPSO solution, which includes an option for EPCI of the FPSO topside. If the project moves forward to the execution phase, the EPCI option potentially represents a significant contract that is estimated to be worth between $960 million and $1.45 billion.",Pos
Cold Weather In North Dakota And Alberta Forces Oil Producers To Curb Production.html,"Regional prices of crude oil pumped in Western Canada and in North Dakota have risen this week to lower their discounts to the U.S. benchmark, WTI Crude, after freezing winter temperatures disrupted crude flows from Alberta’s oil sands and the Bakken shale play in the United States. While frigid winter weather is not uncommon in these parts of North America, temperatures this week fell well below normal, disrupting flows on the Keystone oil pipeline from Canada to the United States that carries close to 600,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude from Alberta’s oil sands to the U.S. Midwest.  Frigid conditions and stormy, snowy weather took over North Dakota this week as an Alberta clipper brought snow and wind gusts, and real-feel temperatures around Grand Forks, North Dakota, plunged to minus 30 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 34 degrees Celsius). Winter weather advisories were issued from Montana to North Dakota, Illinois, and Michigan.  The below-normal winter temperatures in major oil-producing centers such as Alberta and North Dakota led to disruption of oil flows, pushing regional prices higher and contributing to global supply disruptions (and fears of such), which boosted the U.S. benchmark oil price to above $80 a barrel at the end of this week. This was the highest prompt price at which WTI Crude has traded since the middle of November, before the Omicron fears sparked selloffs in late November and early December.  The deep freeze forced TC Energy to shut down the Keystone pipeline for several hours for unplanned maintenance as temperatures in the area of the Hardisty terminal in Alberta were expected to drop to minus 35 Celsius. The emergency maintenance on Keystone began on the evening of Tuesday. The pipeline resumed operations on Wednesday evening, TC Energy said, noting that its operations on the U.S. Gulf Coast remained uninterrupted. 
 Temperatures from Alberta to North Dakota were in deep sub-zero territory, and besides the Keystone pipeline, oil wells were also beginning to get affected.  The price for crudes produced in North Dakota and Alberta started to reflect expectations of tighter supply going forward.  According to Bloomberg estimates, the discount of Western Canadian Select (WCS)—the benchmark price of oil from Canada’s oil sands delivered at Hardisty, Alberta—relative to WTI Crude has narrowed by $3 per barrel from the end of December to $12.10 per barrel this week.   Related: Oil Tops $80 After OPEC+ Sticks To Plan To Ease Cuts The price of the crude from the Bakken shale in North Dakota at the hub at Clearbrook, Minnesota, has increased by $0.90 a barrel and traded at a premium of $1.25 per barrel to the WTI Crude futures—the highest premium in two months. This week, Bakken crude traded in Wyoming at prices higher than WTI Crude prices for the first time since the middle of November due to disruptions caused by the deep freeze. 
 Operators in North Dakota and Alberta are much better prepared for freezing winter conditions than were those in Texas in February last year, so effects on supply were nowhere near the scale seen in the largest oil-producing state in America.  Still, the disruption to oil flows in the oil sands and in the Bakken added to global supply disruptions with Libyan production down by 30 percent these days compared to November, and concerns over supply from OPEC+ group’s member Kazakhstan, a producer of around 1.6 million bpd, where violent, deadly protests erupted this week. U.S. supermajor Chevron, the operator of Kazakhstan’s largest oilfield, Tengiz, said on Thursday that crude oil production from the field was reduced because some logistics contactors disrupted train lines in support of the protests.  As a result of all these supply issues in North America, Kazakhstan, and Libya, plus estimates that OPEC once again undershot by a wide margin its production target under the OPEC+ deal, the price of WTI Crude topped $80 per barrel this week for the first time since mid-November. ",Neg
Nigeria Is Losing Major Investors As Oil Theft Runs Rampant.html,"2021 ended with a report that Nigeria experienced a deficit of almost 200 million barrels of crude in the first 11 months of the year, mainly due to oil theft. But these experiences are all too common, and not limited to Nigeria alone. Year on year, we are seeing huge oil losses because of theft. Oil theft in Nigeria is made easier by several factors. Aging infrastructure, such as oil pipelines, makes it easier for thieves to get access to the crude. In addition, general underinvestment across the sector and poor security of the country’s waterways means little is being done to tackle the crime. Some security agencies even collude with cartels for the pay-out.  While Nigeria hopes to meet its OPEC quota of 1.68 million bpd of crude for January 2022, these types of crimes are making it increasingly difficult. Over the last few months, Nigeria has been producing closer to 1.25 million bpd, demonstrating the uphill battle it must face meeting this target.  And the high prevalence of oil theft is driving international investors away. While the problem persists, oil majors are taking their money to more reliable markets with better monitoring and surveillance practices. Shell, ExxonMobil, Chevron, and Total have all already moved their operations to other regions, despite Nigeria being Africa’s biggest producer.  These thefts equate to $3.5 billion of revenue lost in 2021 alone or around 10 percent of the country’s foreign reserves. It is thought that Nigeria lost 42.25 million barrels in 2019 and 53.28 million barrels in the year prior, owing to oil theft. So, it seems clear that the situation is worsening, perhaps partially due to the economic difficulties faced during the pandemic, as well as the ease of access to aging pipelines and the prevalence of corruption. 
 The Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI), the country’s oil industry auditor, published a report in 2019 that suggested the OPEC state had lost around 138,000 bpd of crude to theft over the previous decade, at a value of around $40.06 billion. In September last year, the Nigerian government set up a committee on the recovery of crude oil and illegally refined petroleum products. The group comprised the Department of Petroleum Resources, the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation, the National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency, the Nigerian Army and Navy, and the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps. But Nigeria still experienced huge losses throughout the rest of the year.  Related: White House Praises OPEC For Production Decision Despite previous discussions about how to prevent this situation from continuing, little investment has been made to curb the trend. For example, there has been an unwillingness to fund technologies that could monitor oil and gas pipelines across the country to recognize sabotage or human interference and prevent theft.  And this is after years of widespread oil theft in Nigeria. In November 2015, thieves stole $250 million worth of crude from just one pipeline, around half a billion liters. As Africa’s biggest oil exporter, it is vital that the government and oil industry work in unison to curb this costly trend before it gets even worse. 
 But this is not a problem that affects Nigeria alone. While most of the oil comes from Nigeria, the effects of the crime spill over into other West African countries, according to the UNODC. Cartels in the Niger Delta region generally steal crude by ‘hot tapping’ – attaching a secondary pipeline to a mainline, or ‘cold tapping’ – blowing up a pipeline and replacing it with their own. They then export this oil illegally to countries such as Ghana, Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire, and South Africa. Some even reach the international market. Corruption comes into play as oil tankers are often over-filled, with exporters bribing officials that control the transportation of the product to turn a blind eye.  While Nigeria is not the only country to face oil theft directly, with case studies on Ghana, Morocco, Uganda, Mozambique, Mexico, Thailand, Azerbaijan, and Turkey, to name a few, it experiences the most significant average losses by far. The lucrative nature of the crime makes it all the more common in poorer states. For example, in 2009, tapping a Mexican pipeline for seven minutes to access its refined oil could earn a cartel $90,000. While oil theft across the global industry averaged 70,000 bpd of crude output in August 2020, Nigeria experience significantly higher losses. While its oil production levels remain high, the government and oil industry must tackle the crime head-on, through better pipeline monitoring and evaluation, if they hope to attract greater foreign investment in the industry. Having lost the funding of some of the world’s supermajors, and experiencing a drop in production levels following the pandemic, Nigeria is facing an uphill battle as OPEC raises its quotas. Reducing the prevalence of oil theft could strongly support the ongoing development of the country’s oil industry. ",Neg
US Rig Count Rises Alongside Oil Prices.html,"The number of active drilling rigs in the United States rose by 2 this week, keeping the total rig count at 588, as oil prices remain strong despite the fresh wave of Covid-19 cases brought by the new variant of the coronavirus amid several oil disruptions around the globe, including in Libya, Ecuador, and Kazahkstan. Last week's count compared with an unchanged rig count of 586 during the previous week. Baker Hughes reported the total active rig figure was 228 rigs higher than the rig count this time in 2021.
 Oil-directed rigs were up by 1 to 481, while gas-directed rigs were up by 1 to 107. Oil production in the U.S. last week—the last week of 2021—stood at 11.8 million bpd for the second week in a row, according to the Energy Information Administration. This is up from 11 million bpd at the beginning of 2021. While U.S. production remains on an upward trend, oil drillers remain cautious in their production growth plans and more focused on returning cash to investors.
 The rig count in the Permian Basin decreased by 1 again this week. The number of rigs in the nation's second most prolific basin, the Eagle Ford, saw no change to the number of active rigs for the second week in a row. The Permian's total rig count is now 292, with 44 total in the Eagle Ford. Primary Vision's Frac Spread Count, which tracks the number of completion crews finishing off previously drilled wells, shows that completion crews fell by 10 this week to 234 for week ending December 31, for the fifth dip in a row. The frac spread is now down 40 over the last five weeks. At 9:55 a.m. EDT, oil prices were trending down on the day. WTI was trading at $79.28—down 0.23% on the day but up nearly $4 on the week. The Brent benchmark traded at $81.98, down 0.01% on the day but up nearly $4 on the week.",Pos
EOG Resources Bucks The Trend Says Its Ready To Boost Oil Production.html,"EOG Resources, one of the largest operators in the U.S. shale patch, has signaled it would be willing to boost oil production if there is demand for it. In a video conference hosted by Goldman Sachs, chief executive Ezra Yacob said EOG could return to pre-pandemic production levels this year as long as it makes economic sense. “EOG would be in a position to return to pre-Covid levels of production,” Yacob said, as quoted by Bloomberg. “If the world has a call on oil and there’s room to grow our low-cost, lower- emissions barrels into the market, we can certainly deliver on that.”
 U.S. oil producers, especially those in the shale patch, have been focusing on shareholder returns amid the pandemic, after years of plowing billions into higher production only to see it slump as the lockdowns began last year. Facing disgruntled shareholders, shale producers chose to keep production lower and boost dividends and other payouts instead. Investor attitude has been one of the reasons the shale industry did not respond to calls from the White House for higher oil production as the administration struggled to put a lid on prices at the pump. The other reason has been the White House’s choice to turn to OPEC for this kind of help first, overlooking the domestic oil industry.
 The outlook for oil demand remains bullish for now, not least because there are doubts that OPEC and its partners in OPEC+ have the spare capacity they need to continue adding 400,000 bpd to it. Recent production outages in Libya and Kazakhstan have also cast a shadow over the group’s plans for a return to pre-pandemic production levels. With demand seen strong, this has opened up opportunities for non-OPEC producers such as U.S. shale drillers to step in and fill the potential gap in supply that some analysts warn may appear later this year.",Pos
Oil Jumps As Key Kazakhstan Oil Field Gets Hit By Protests.html,"Crude oil jumped sharply on Thursday and remained high on Friday after reports that the protests in Kazakhstan had disrupted production at its biggest field, Tengiz. Brent crude was trading at over $82 per barrel at the time of writing, with West Texas Intermediate at over $80 a barrel after news that oil production at Tengiz, in the Caspian Sea, was reduced. According to a Reuters report, the reduction was related to disruptions to train lines caused by some contractors working in the field who had declared their support for the protesters.
 ""TCO production operations continue, however, there has been a temporary adjustment to output due to logistics,"" said Chevron, the operator of the field as part of the Tengizchevroil consortium, or TCO. Kazakhstan produces some 1.6 million bpd of crude oil, of which 700,000 bpd come from Tengiz. Under the OPEC+ oil cut deal, the central Asian country has been producing less, although it has been criticized by its partners for failing to comply with the cuts. For February, Kazakhstan's quota is 1.589 million barrels daily. Protests erupted in Kazakhstan earlier this week over higher fuel prices. The government had lifted price controls on liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), which many Kazakhs use to fuel their LPG-converted vehicles because it's cheaper than gasoline. The rise in fuel prices also resulted in a surge in consumer goods. The protests continued even after the government resigned to appease the protesters and turned violent.
 In response, President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev said the price cap on LPG will be reinstalled, and prices will be reduced. Despite this, protests continued, with Reuters reporting earlier today that police had killed dozens of protesters and arrested 2,000. Some 18 members of Kazakh security forces were dead, too. Russia was sending in paratroops to help put down the protests under a Collective Security Treaty Organization decision. The CSTO is an intergovernmental security alliance between several former Soviet states, including Russia, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan.",Pos
Goldman Sachs Commodity Supercycle Could Last A Decade.html,"Oil prices could reach $95 if Iran doesn’t return to the market this year, while commodities overall are set for a supercycle that could potentially last a decade, according to Goldman Sachs, which is “extremely bullish” on the whole commodity complex. Currently, we are seeing record dislocations in energy markets, metals markets, and agriculture markets, Jeff Currie, global head of commodities research at Goldman Sachs, told Bloomberg Television in an interview on Thursday. There is still a lot of money in the system, while investment positions in commodities are very low, which is setting the stage for further upsides in oil prices and the prices of other commodities, Currie said. “The best place to be right now, particularly given the Fed pivot, are commodities,” Goldman Sachs’s global head of commodities told Bloomberg.
 “We think you’re going to see another year of out-performance of commodities and real assets more broadly,” Currie added. Goldman Sachs basically reiterates its core thesis from October 2020: this is the beginning of a supercycle in commodities that could last up to a decade, he said. Specifically referring to oil, Goldman’s head of commodities is also very bullish due to low investment in the sector and the fact that only two oil producers in the world—Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE)—currently have the capacity and the means to pump more oil than they did in January 2020, just before COVID. Everyone else is struggling, Currie said.   “This market has the potential to get very tight going over the course of next 3-6 months,” he added.
 Goldman’s call for Brent Crude prices for the first quarter of 2022 is $85 per barrel, assuming that Iran could legitimately return to the market later this year. But an Iranian return now looks increasingly unlikely, and without Iranian exports, we could be looking at $95 oil, according to Currie. Last month, Goldman Sachs forecast crude oil prices could hit $100 in 2023 as demand growth outpaces supply growth.",Neutral
Will The Permian Merger Mania Continue Into 2022.html,"The Permian shale play, the star of the shale patch, witnessed a hot merger and acquisition year in 2021 amid the pandemic as many companies sought to gain an edge over competitors by either increasing their presence in the play or in the case of Shell, leaving it altogether. Shell's exit from the Permian cost ConocoPhillips $9.5 billion in cash, boosting its position in the Permian quite considerably at a time when the play continues to be a magnet for an industry no longer committed to production growth at all costs. Independents are perhaps even more active in dealmaking. Earthstone Energy, a Texas-based oil producer, last month paid some $600 million for assets in the Delaware Basin—one of the most attractive parts of the Permian—with the deal slated to close by the end of March this year. Earthstone said the acquisition would increase its production by 39 percent. Another Texas-based driller, Abraxas Petroleum Corporation, earlier this month said it had sold all of its assets in North Dakota in order to focus on operations in the Permian. According to the company's chief executive, the move would help Abraxas reduce its debt load and boost returns to shareholders. Consolidation is also ongoing in the most prolific U.S. shale play. Last month, private equity firm EnCap Investments merged two of its portfolio companies operating in the Permian into a $4-billion company that the owner plans to take public this year. The plan signals continued optimism for the oil sector despite the ESG push and banks' growing reluctance to lend to oil and gas.
  The trend is a continuation from last year when consolidation really took off in the Permian amid record-low interest rates, improving oil prices, and a bullish demand outlook for crude. In the second and third quarters of the year alone, deals worth a total of $30 billion took place, including Shell's sale to Conoco.  According to Evaluate Energy, which publishes quarterly reports on upstream M&A, the second quarter of 2021 saw deals worth $18 billion during the second quarter and $12 billion during the third quarter. The figures for the fourth quarter have yet to come out, but they are likely to have remained robust even though a certain slowdown is likely to have been recorded. The slowdown was increased regulatory scrutiny on deals amid high gasoline prices that made consumers critical of how the government is handling essential commodities. This growing criticism prompted antitrust authorities to extend the review period for at least five mergers and acquisitions in the oil and gas space during the final quarter of 2021, Reuters reported in December. The scrutiny is unprecedented, according to a former acting chair of the Federal Trade Commission, who told Reuters that the new chair of the FTC may actually want to deter mergers in the oil and gas industry.
 ""Even though previous Democratic FTC commissioners wanted active enforcement, the industry was told what the standards were, deals got reviewed and things moved along. This is really different,"" Maureen Ohlhausen said. ""I believe the FTC Chair, effectively, would like to deter mergers."" ""I am aware of two mergers in the last couple of months where FTC staff did not see a need to issue a second request but were overruled by their management,"" said the chair of antitrust practice at law firm Vinson & Ellis, Darren Tucker, as quoted by Reuters. If this is indeed the case, it may affect the immediate future of dealmaking in the Permian and will likely deepen an already unfriendly sentiment in the industry towards the administration. Whether this increased scrutiny would eventually lead to lower prices at the pump, however, remains an open question.",Neutral
Saudi Arabia Cuts Oil Prices For Asia In February.html,"Saudi Arabia cut the prices of all the crude grades it will be selling to Asia in February to the lowest premium to regional benchmarks in three months, amid the rapid spread of Omicron and higher OPEC+ supply to the markets. The Kingdom, the world’s largest crude oil exporter, reduced the price of its flagship Arab Light crude grade for the Asian market by $1.10 a barrel to $2.20 per barrel over the Oman/Dubai benchmark, off which Middle Eastern exports to Asia are being priced. The premium over Oman/Dubai is the lowest for the Saudi Arab Light grade in three months, Reuters notes. All Saudi grades sold in Asia in February will see their official selling prices (OSPs) reduced by between $1.00 and $1.30 per barrel.
 Industry officials had widely expected a cut in Saudi prices for Asia for February, after last month’s large increase in OSPs for January. In December, Saudi Arabia raised its official selling prices for its Arab Light oil to Asia in January by $0.60 per barrel to a premium of $3.30 a barrel above the Oman/Dubai benchmark—the highest spread since before the pandemic. The price hike in December for January loadings suggested expectations of strong demand, which in turn implied that Saudi Arabia was not all that worried about the Omicron variant that caused a more than $10 plunge in oil prices in late November, with Brent at one point dipping below $70 per barrel.
 Today’s cut for February suggests that the world’s top oil exporter expects somewhat weaker demand in Asia with the Omicron surge and China’s zero-COVID policy, analysts say. For customers outside Asia, Saudi Arabia left unchanged the prices of all its grades to the United States, slightly cut the prices for northwest Europe, and left OSPs for the Mediterranean region mostly unchanged, with the exception of a $0.20 per barrel cut in the price of Arab Light versus the ICE Brent benchmark. ",Neg
Crude Prices Slip On Major Dip In US Gasoline Demand.html,"Crude oil prices fell slightly today after the Energy Information Administration reported an inventory decline of 2.1 million barrels for the final week of 2021. This compared with a draw of 3.6 million barrels for the previous week, with the total remaining below the average for this time of the year. In gasoline, the EIA estimated an inventory build of 10.1 million barrels for the week to December 31, 2021. This compared with a draw of 1.5 barrels for the previous week. Gasoline production averaged 8.5 million bpd last week, which compared with 10.1 million bpd a week earlier.
 Middle distillate stocks added 4.4 million barrels in the final week of 2021, which compared with an inventory decline of 1.7 million barrels for the previous week. Middle distillate production in the week to December 31 averaged 5.0 million bpd, compared with 4.9 million bpd in the previous week. Refineries last week processed 15.9 barrels of crude daily, operating at 89.8 percent of capacity. Imports stood at 5.9 million bpd. Earlier in the week, OPEC+ announced it would add another 400,000 bpd to combined production next month in an unsurprising move that confirmed its confidence demand for crude oil would continue strong this year despite worries about the Omicron variant.
 These worries seem to be subsiding, by the way, despite record infection numbers, with the United States breaking all records with 1 million cases reported on Monday. Hospitalization rates with the new variant, however, appear to indeed be lower, giving cause for some measured optimism. “Though Omicron cases continue to climb in key geographies, the absence of widespread lockdown restrictions will likely keep near-term demand concerns in check,” RBC analysts said in a note on Tuesday, as quoted by CNBC. At the time of writing, Brent crude was trading at $81.01 a barrel, after touching $80 a barrel yesterday following the OPEC+ meeting. West Texas Intermediate was trading at $77.99 a barrel.",Neg
The Biggest Challenge Facing Bidens Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Plan.html,"Last month the Biden administration released a plan to build a network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations across the country. President Biden considers this an essential part of the fight against climate change by enabling the continued rollout of electric vehicles. In announcing the plan, Vice President Kamala Harris noted, “When we ask people what is the biggest barrier for them to buy an electric car, the answer is almost always figuring out where and how to charge it”.  The plan emphasizes standardization as the charging network expands from the current patchwork of 100,000 public charging outlets. EV owners are well aware of the challenges of navigating the current fractured EV charging network, which have different outlets, payment options, and hardware hookups.  President Biden had sought $15 billion for the plan, but Congress cut that amount in half in the recently-passed infrastructure bill. Nevertheless, the Administration has stuck to the original plan, with $5 billion deployed to states, territories and the District of Columbia. The remaining $2.5 billion will be targeted at putting charging stations in rural areas.  Fast chargers are needed, because the amount of time it takes to charge a vehicle is another factor influencing the decision to purchase an electric vehicle. But the reduced funding likely means more slower charging stations. Level 2 charging stations require 2-10 hours to fully recharge a depleted battery. Higher power and more expensive Level 3 charging stations can achieve this in 30 minutes. This means most EV customers will likely need to do most of their charging overnight at home. 
  But the faster Level 3 charging stations will need to be strategically located along major highways and interstates to serve drivers on long-distance trips – a necessity especially if EVs are to play a larger role in commercial transportation. Presently there are vast stretches of EV deserts across the U.S. Midwest and South, and that is a major hindrance for those wanting to buy an EV. Beyond the charging speed, a massive buildout in EV charging capacity will require more power and more grid capacity to supply them. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has estimated that by 2030 EVs could require between 525 terawatt-hours (TWh) and 860 TWh of electricity globally, up from 80 TWh last year. This is equivalent to more than three times the current power consumption of California. The California state government is facing a formidable challenge, given its increasing reliance on renewables while facing extreme climate conditions that severely strain the grid. Current rates of new power plant commissioning are slower than what would be needed to achieve 100 percent clean energy by 2045, as set out by the California Energy Commission, while not all power plants newly in operation are using clean resources. A case in point are the temporary gas plants to avoid blackouts during summer. Even so, California – home to nearly half of all EVs in the U.S. – is at the forefront of vehicle-grid integration. The state intends to stop selling gasoline-powered passenger cars by 2035, so it has launched a number of initiatives to ensure that EVs don’t overwhelm the state’s electric utility infrastructure.  Southern California Edison has launched a $436 million program to install 38,000 electric car chargers over the next five years. The program will incentivize smart charging during the day when solar energy is at its peak, and power is cheapest as a result. 
 But there are other innovative solutions being developed by several start-ups, which could help. L-Charge, for example, has developed a charging station that’s off the grid entirely and can charge 100 km (roughly 60 miles) in just 5-10 minutes. The company has developed both a stationary and mobile version of its chargers. The stationary version can be located in conventional locations, but the mobile version can actually travel around a city and charge vehicles on demand. Meanwhile, Amazon-backed startup Span has developed a smart electrical panel, capable of being paired with a Level 2 EV charger. Span panel can be paired with Amazon’s voice recognition interface, Alexa. This integration will make it easier for homeowners to identify the largest power users in the home at any given time. In turn, that could help balance the energy load and charge EVs only when there’s spare electricity capacity.  In many areas, tapping into the grid means charging an EV with fossil fuel-generated power. But the mobile charging station developed by L-Charge, which runs on relatively low-emission liquefied natural gas (LNG) or hydrogen, also offers a solution that doesn’t involve additional strain on the grid. This is an important innovation in a world in which demands on the grid are expected to grow rapidly over the next decade. In the long run, electric vehicles may both accelerate the shift to renewable energy and help stabilize the grid. Many homeowners will increasingly rely on solar power they generate themselves to charge their EVs, and this could displace significant fossil fuel power sources over the next decade. But if this transition is going to proceed on an aggressive schedule, the Biden administration’s plan will need to be supplemented by investment in faster-charging stations and in bolstering the electrical grid or developing off-grid solutions.",Neutral
OPEC Continues To Struggle To Produce As Much As Quotas Allow.html,"The OPEC+ group continues to deliver lower supply increases than the monthly production quotas, according to the alliance’s estimates of compliance with the November crude oil output quotas. In November 2021, the members of the OPEC+ agreement complied with the production cuts at 117 percent, Amena Bakr, Deputy Bureau Chief and Chief Opec Correspondent at Energy Intelligence, reported on Tuesday, quoting delegates at the ongoing monthly OPEC+ meeting. The high conformity level with the cuts—over 100 percent—suggests that OPEC+ is actually producing lower volumes overall than the collective quotas.
 The ten OPEC members bound by the OPEC+ pact—and excluding exempted producers Iran, Venezuela, and Libya—complied with the cuts at a massive 122 percent, while the conformity level of the non-OPEC members led by Russia was 107 percent, Energy Intelligence’s Bakr notes. This suggests that the OPEC members in OPEC+ faced more difficulties in pumping as much as their quotas dictated than the non-OPEC producers. The OPEC+ group has been undershooting its collective production targets for months and will likely continue to do so in the months ahead, analysts say. African OPEC members lack the capacity and investments to boost production, Russia is estimated to pump and export lower volumes than its quota, and the biggest Arab Gulf producers have the means to raise output but at the expense of shrinking their spare production capacity, which accounts for the majority of the spare capacity globally.
 The alliance’s inability to deliver on its production targets—with some estimates putting the overall output at around 650,000 bpd-730,000 bpd below the collective quota—is set to support oil prices next year, analysts say. This underproduction could even become a major upside for oil this year, especially if Omicron’s dent to global oil demand remains limited to jet fuel, as the most recent estimates and analyses showed at the end of 2021. ",Neg
How Iran Could Trigger The Next 10 Percent Drop In Oil Prices.html,"Given ongoing high and steady sales of crude oil to China and other Asian countries and the likelihood of a new iteration of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) being agreed with the U.S. at some point this year, Iran announced plans last week to boost oil production from its supergiant South Azadegan oil field to at least 320,000 barrels per day (bpd) by the middle of 2023, from the current 140,000 bpd. This output from South Azadegan, and corollary increases in North Azadegan and other major fields that make up the oil-rich cluster of fields in the West Karoun region, will enable Iran to meet its long-standing target of 1 million bpd from this specific region within the next year or two, according to recent comments from the National Iranian Oil Company’s (NIOC) managing director, Mohsen Khojastehmehr. To this end, OilPrice.com understands from sources close to Iran’s Petroleum Ministry, Javad Owji – the country’s new Petroleum Minister, met recently with senior representatives from China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) to discuss the development status of the West Karoun fields in general and of the South and North Azadegan fields in particular. As analysed in depth in my new book on the global oil markets, the development of the West Karoun fields up to a level where they are producing the requisite 1 million bpd of crude oil output was a key part of China’s obligations under the wide-ranging 25-year deal between Iran and China. According to the Iranian sources spoken to exclusively by OilPrice.com at the time, China in return is able to buy any and all oil gas, and petchems products at a minimum guaranteed discount of 12 percent to the six-month rolling mean average price of comparable benchmark products, plus another 6 to 8 percent of that metric for risk-adjusted compensation. Indeed, in the series of deals exclusively reported at the time by OilPrice.com that showed that the official figures showing Iranian crude oil exports stood at negligible levels were nonsense, each of the 5.8 million barrels of oil in total that were sent to China from Iran via the Giessel, Stream, and Snow tankers were discounted by at least a clear US$10.95 to the headline Iranian grade price. In addition to this straight discount, according to the Iranian sources exclusively spoken to by OilPrice.com at the time, an additional 8 to 12 percent discount proceeded from exchange rate differentials, and also Iran was offering (and still offers) offers China cost, insurance, and freight (CIF) cargoes at free-on-board (FOB) pricing.
  Despite all of these enticements, however, China – according to comments from Iran’s NIOC, and the reason behind Owji’s recent meeting with CNPC executives in Tehran – has been delaying on the full implementation of the development plan for the entre Azadegan site. “In recent years, for various reasons, we have lost part of our oil production capacity and joint fields are lagging behind the development plan,” said Khojastehmehr. “The South Azadegan project had been awarded to China for an output of 320,000 barrels per day and under the 11th administration this agreement did not take effect for various reasons, leading to US$6 billion in lucrum cessans [basically, ‘lost profits’],” he added. According to the Iranian sources spoken to exclusively by OilPrice.com last week, the lack of decisive movement on South Azadegan (and any of the West Karoun sites) has largely been a result of the reticence of China to antagonise the U.S. government with overt actions in Iran whilst the Trade War issues are still in play. China’s usual workaround solution to this – to engage in dozens of ‘contract-only’ projects on the same site that do not attract the same sort of attention as major development and exploration activities - has been stretched by similar activities across multiple other sites in the Middle East, notably in Iraq in recent months. “However, it was decided at the meeting with Owji that China would put South Azadegan back up its list of priorities this year,” said one of the Iranian sources last week.
 For Iran, the exploitation of South Azadegan’s full potential is crucial for three key reasons in its plans to achieve a quick bounce back to pre-sanctions crude oil production levels as soon as possible after sanctions are withdrawn as and when a new iteration of the JCPOA is agreed with the U.S. Firstly, South Azadegan was originally going to be lead-developed by France’s TotalEnergies, after the initial work on Phase 11 of South Pars had been completed, so the desire to make this a success now that the French company has pulled out of Iran entirely is profound, said the Iran source. Secondly, South Azadegan – and its sister field, North Azadegan – draw on the same deposit as neighbouring Iraq’s Majnoon field, which makes developing it quickly essential in order that Iraq does not benefit from the site at Iran’s expense or destroy the favourable geology of the field through its drilling. And thirdly, South Azadegan is a key field in the massive West Karoun group of oilfields, also comprising North Azadegan, North Yaran, South Yaran, and Yadavaran, which together are estimated to contain at least 67 billion barrels of oil in place but also, propitiously, the average recovery rate across the West Karoun site is just 5-6 percent. “For every one percent increase in the rate of recovery that can be achieved, the recoverable reserves figure increase by 670 million barrels, or around US$34 billion in revenues with oil at US$50 a barrel,” one of the Iran sources highlighted. With the right developers, an increase in recovery rate across the site to at least 25% over a 20 year contract period could be expected to add US$838 billion in revenues for Iran, he added. The impact on the oil price of such an increase from South Azadegan and then from the additional input from all of the West Karoun fields would be significant, particularly against a background of uncertain demand in the coming months, given ongoing uncertainties over the Covid-19 pandemic and over China’s likely marked decrease in economic growth, as analysed by OilPrice.com recently. Even without any of these production increases, a senior commodity analyst at global energy markets intelligence company, Kpler, told OilPrice.com that Iranian crude oil and condensate production could bounce back very quickly after the Petroleum Ministry orders the NIOC to ramp up production – to an 80 percent recovery of full production within six months and to 100 percent recovery within 12 months. “[As at the beginning of Q4 2021] Iranian crude oil production capacity stands at 3 9 to 4 million bpd according to the NIOC with current output holding near 2 4 million bpd, of which 1.7-1.8 million bpd is consumed in domestic refineries, and close to 1 million bpd of condensate and natural gas liquids [NGL] - LPG [liquefied petroleum gas] and ethane - are also being produced at present, primarily from the South Pars gas field, although total condensate and NGL production capacity stands at around 1 3 million bpd,” said the Kpler analyst. “Ultimately, we believe Iranian production could technically jump by 1 7 million bpd including 200,000 bpd of condensate and LPG/ethane, in a 6 to 9 month period from when sanctions are lifted,” the analyst added. “An immediate impact of a 5-10 percent fall in the oil price would be likely,” the analyst concluded.",Neg
OPEC Sees Smaller Oil Market Surplus In Q1.html,"OPEC+ expects the surplus on the oil market in the first quarter of 2022 to be 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd), or some 25 percent lower than it forecast in early December, Bloomberg reported on Monday, citing internal OPEC+ research a day before the group is set to announce its production policy for February. Lower expected oil supply from non-OPEC+ producing nations was the key reason for a downgrade in the surplus estimate, according to Bloomberg. Expectations of strong demand this year have also resulted in a lower surplus forecast for the full 2022, according to the internal document the Joint Technical Committee (JTC) is reviewing today, ahead of the OPEC+ ministerial meeting on January 4.
 OPEC+ now sees overall 2022 oil market surplus at 1.4 million bpd, down from an early December estimate of a 1.7-million-bpd oversupply. The group continues to see the Omicron impact on demand as “mild and short-lived,” just as OPEC said in its Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR) in mid-December. At the start of December, the OPEC+ alliance expected a larger oil market surplus to the tune of 2 million bpd and more during the first quarter of 2022. Those expectations were part of analyst forecasts that OPEC+ could pause its monthly production additions in view of the Omicron uncertainty and large surpluses expected for 2022.
 Yet, OPEC+ decided on December 2 to stick to its initial plans to add 400,000 barrels per day to its collective oil production each month. Days before this month’s meeting on Tuesday, January 4, the general market sentiment and expectations are that the alliance would likely proceed with its oil production policy of the past few months by deciding to add another 400,000 barrels per day to its collective output quota",Pos
Russia May Be Nearing Limit Of Oil Output Capacity.html,"Russia may be nearing the limit of its oil production capacity, according to recent media reports. Bloomberg reported that the country's December oil and condensate output together totaled 10.903 million bpd, which was flat on November, suggesting it was using up all its available production capacity. The report notes it assumes a flat production of condensates, which are included in Russia's total oil output, which would mean that crude oil output alone was 37,000 bpd below Russia's OPEC+ quota for December.
 At the same time, Reuters reported that analysts expected Russia to fall short of its target of returning to pre-pandemic levels of oil production by May this year. Yet the analysts added the country could boost its spare capacity and production alike later in the year. ""It's possible that Russia will be behind the output increase schedule in the first half of 2022 and not reach its pre-crisis level until the end of summer,"" the report quoted Dmitry Manchenko from Fitch Ratings as saying. Yet Russia has production boost plans for the year. Deputy Prime Minister and top OEPC+ negotiator Alexander Novak said last month, as quoted by Argus, that plans were to boost oil and condensate output this year by 3 to 5 percent.
 This would mean a daily average of between 10.8 and 11 million bpd, Argus reported, up from an average of 10.5 million bpd last year. The report noted that Russia had exceeded its OPEC+ production quota every month of 2021 until November. The Bloomberg report noted that most of Russia's production growth so far this year has been from reopened wells that were shut down last year amid the pandemic demand crunch. Now, it's down to new drilling to add more barrels, according to officials from Lukoil and Gazprom Neft. The latter, by the way, expects strong growth in production and revenues this year.",Neg
OPEC Expects Mild Impact From Omicron On Oil Markets.html,"OPEC+ expects the effect of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus on oil prices to be mild and temporary, Reuters reported, citing a technical report by the group. ""The impact of the new Omicron variant is expected to be mild and short-lived, as the world becomes better equipped to manage COVID-19 and its related challenges,"" the report, by the extended cartel's Joint Technical Committee, said. ""This is in addition to a steady economic outlook in both the advanced and emerging economies.""
 OPEC + is meeting this week to discuss output plans, and the report suggests the group may decide to continue sticking with its original schedule of adding 400,000 bpd to combined output every month until production returns to pre-pandemic levels. A recent Bloomberg poll also pointed in that direction, even though some members have found it hard to pump as much as their quotas allow them. Russia notably may have failed to take full advantage of its December quota, producing some 10.93 million bpd of crude and condensate, according to Bloomberg, which noted, however, that it was difficult to asset the crude oil component of the total. The agency then assumed a flat condensate output to estimate crude oil output had been 37,000 bpd below the December OPEC+ quota.
 White Russia's shortfall may or may not be a fact, West African oil producers are indeed struggling to produce as much as their quotas allow them. According to a recent Argus report, Nigeria was the only West African member of OPEC to increase production in November, but the increase fell short of its target. Whatever the production challenges of OPEC+, it is important for the cartel to get across the message that it is not bothered by omicron or by planned reserve releases of crude oil from the U.S., Japan, and South Korea.",Pos
Fossil Fuel Financing Under Pressure As Wall Street Caves To ESG Demands.html,"Most U.S. oil and gas firms expect to raise their capital expenditures next year, as analysts have largely forecast in recent months. Yet, capital available to the industry is constantly shrinking as banks continue to shun the sector due to ESG pressures and as the Biden Administration, with its green agenda and anti-oil policies, is discouraging many in the shale patch from boosting capital budgets beyond the bare minimum.  These were some of the comments and views expressed in the Dallas Fed Energy Survey for the fourth quarter released this week, which showed the oil and gas industry’s frustration with constrained funding availability from banks and with the uncertainty the U.S. Administration’s green policies poses to the future of America’s oil and gas production.     Low capital availability will ultimately lead to higher oil and gas prices, U.S. oil and gas executives said in the latest Dallas Fed Energy Survey.   Access to expanding credit on reserve base loans was already flagged as one of the greatest headwinds to the industry—alongside restricted skilled labor supply—by an executive in the previous survey for the third quarter.  In the fourth quarter, shale executives didn’t spare criticism of the Biden Administration’s policies toward the sector. This follows months of U.S. officials begging OPEC+ for higher oil output instead of turning to their own domestic companies, which, given certainty over future policies, could have been more willing to invest in drilling additional wells and increasing production, helping to tame the oil price rally.  The Administration faced the highest gasoline prices in America in seven years, yet it turned to OPEC+ first to ask for more oil supply. The U.S. shale patch didn’t take that well and is now wary of committing more capital to production. The key factors behind the cautious approach are policy uncertainties, investor demands for higher returns, and banks’ reluctance to fund the industry due to ESG considerations and political and societal pressure on lenders to cut financing for fossil fuels.  Low capital availability from banks is a problem for everyone in America—and in the world for that matter—as it would lead to higher commodity prices, which will do the opposite of what the Biden Administration desperately wants: lower gasoline prices.  “A Problem For Everyone”
 “Constrained capital will lead to significantly higher commodity prices. And it isn’t the administration’s fault—this is a Wall Street and environmental, social and governance-led charge,” one executive said in the comments accompanying the survey for the fourth quarter.  “Despite us being one of the top-performing energy funds in America, investors are cutting our funding by 80 percent. We believe this is a two-edged sword—if it is happening to us, it is likely happening to everyone,” the executive added.   “The political pressure forcing available capital away from the energy industry is a problem for everyone,” another executive at an exploration and production (E&P) firm noted.  “Banks view lending to the energy industry as having a “political risk,” the executive added.  Uncertainties Ahead  ESG concerns, pressure from investors, and the Administration’s policies have been the three key factors why U.S. oil and gas production hasn’t ramped up quickly with the rise in commodity prices in 2021, according to Douglas Beath, Global Investment Strategist at Wells Fargo.  Yet, U.S. oil and gas production could accelerate growth again, the bank says, firstly because “The American consumer has become increasingly frustrated with higher gas prices and may force the Biden administration to rethink its current energy strategy.”  Shale executives also find that the ESG trend, the green agenda push, and the Administration’s anti-oil policies are key factors for greater uncertainty in their business and plans for capital expenditures for 2022 and beyond. 
 Some said Wall Street’s ESG trend is to blame for restrained capital, while others laid the blame squarely on the Biden Administration.  “With the current administration in Washington being so anti-fossil-fuel industry, I question how much longer I will stay in the business. The good news is that they have so little understanding of the free market that prices usually spike with the Democrats in charge,” an executive said in the comments to the Q4 Dallas Fed Energy Survey.  Overall, the Dallas Fed Energy Survey showed that while oil and gas activity in the Eleventh District comprising Texas, southern New Mexico, and northern Louisiana continued to expand this quarter, costs jumped for yet another quarter to signal significant cost pressures.  Due to uncertainties over capital availability and domestic policies, some executives say they cannot provide detailed expectations of capital investment in 2022.  “Why would any rational person feel comfortable with expanding capital commitments beyond minimum maintenance requirements at most when nominees at the federal level are hoping for bankruptcy and closure of the oil and gas sector,” an E&P executive said.  Another top manager said:  “The push for going all green will cause more energy shortages and much higher prices. Like the pilot said, “Sit down and put your seat belts on. It’s going to get a bit bumpy.” ",Pos
2022 Could Be A Great Year For OPEC Producers.html,"OPEC+ did some surprising things in the past two years. First, it broke up at the start of the pandemic with its two leaders—Saudi Arabia and Russia—turning on each other because of differences of opinion on how the crisis needed to be handled. Then the two made up, and the group united around the deepest production cuts in the history of OPEC in response to the demand destruction caused by the pandemic, also unprecedented. All in all, 2020 was a year of unprecedented events. But this year was not that much different. It was a challenging one for OPEC+ as prices began to recover, presenting a temptation that has always been difficult to resist, especially for the most oil-dependent economies in the Gulf and Africa. And yet resist they did, sticking to a production increase plan seen adding 400,000 bpd in combined oil production every month. This plan is still in action, at least until January, when OPEC+ may reconsider as some analysts warn of looming oil oversupply. OPEC's analysts are not among these—the cartel expects a mild and temporary effect on demand from the omicron variant of the coronavirus. But the cartel has proved in the past two years that it could be cautious. Bloomberg's Julian Lee earlier this week reminded us that ever since its inception, the extended OPEC+ cartel has had its work cut out for it. From the very beginning, when members decided to reduce production in response to the U.S. shale boom, to this year, when they had to be flexible with production amid wave after wave of Covid-19 infections, it's been a challenging five years for OPEC+. The challenging nature of the cooperation was only to be expected given the often different priorities of member states. And yet it somehow worked, even with bumps along the road such as Iraq's inability to stick to its production quotas, for which it had to be ""punished"" by getting additional cut quotas. And this may well have made the group more resilient to any future shocks.
 According to analysts, the first challenge would be excess supply. It would not be much of a challenge, however, as it is seen as temporary, only until the omicron wave passes, and assuming it would be as bad as previous waves, which is a bit unlikely for a very pragmatic reason: most governments cannot afford another long lockdown. A much bigger challenge, as noted by oil industry observers and OPEC members, is dwindling spare production supply. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, OPEC's spare capacity could fall to 5.11 million bpd in the final quarter of next year. This is down from 9 million bpd in the first quarter of 2021. The Energy Information Administration defines spare oil production capacity as oil production that can be started within 30 days and sustained for at least 90 days. The International Energy Agency defines spare capacity as production that can be cranked up in 90 days. Whatever the definition, the world's spare oil production capacity is falling because it is not a static pool of oil. Oil reservoirs that are not exploited tend to diminish in resources—one big reason why so many oil producers were reluctant to start plugging wells when the pandemic killed demand. Once you plug a well, it may or may not return to full or any production. Speaking of plugging wells, these may well be part of the reason Russia is now near its capacity of producing oil, and it's a much lower level than before the pandemic. Before, Russia was pumping north of 11 million bpd. Now, according to a Reuters report citing Russian oil companies, total output is nearing capacity at 10.9 million bpd, even though Deputy PM Alexander Novak has argued Russia's oil production will rebound to 11.33 million bpd by May.
  Related: Is SpaceX Blocking Out Rivals In The Satellite Race? Most of the spare capacity, therefore, will be in OPEC, and more precisely, in the Middle East. But even that spare capacity needs maintenance, and maintenance means investment. And investments in oil production are getting harder to come by these days. ""We're heading toward a phase that could be dangerous if there's not enough spending on energy,"" Saudi Arabia's Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said earlier this month. The sentiment was echoed by Finance Minister Mohammed Al-Jadaan: ""We have very serious concerns that the world could run short of energy if we are not careful in managing the transition."" It's not just the Saudis that are warning about underinvestment, either. IHS Markit's Daniel Yergin said the world is painting itself into a corner featuring a series of energy crunches because of insufficient investment in oil and gas. And it's public knowledge that U.S. oil companies are prioritizing returning cash to investors rather than production growth while Big Oil is pouring billions in low-carbon energy to clean up its reputation. What all this means is that the world may be in for a few more tough years in terms of energy security, especially parts of it. OPEC+, on the other hand, may be in for some more windfall profits as the supply of oil remains tight for purely fundamental reasons. Of course, there is always the possibility of another demand destruction event in case the pandemic continues to surprise us, but OPEC+ has already been there and has done that. It will survive and maybe even become stronger.",Pos
Activists Demand An Immediate End To Oil Production.html,"Europe may be in the grips of an energy shortage and forced to reopen retired coal plants to cope but climate activists insist that it is time to part company with fossil fuels, the sooner, the better. According to them, this is a simple solution to the world’s emission problems.  “It is overflowing with too much carbon. The world can’t absorb any more,” said Tom Goldtooth, an activist and the executive director of the North American Indigenous Environmental Network on the sidelines of COP26, as quoted by CNBC. “The simple solution, that we are still demanding, is the world has to turn the valve off.” Yet the solution of turning off the valve appears to not be as simple as it may sound. Goldtooth is neither the first nor the last activist to call for an immediate end to oil and gas production. Earlier this year, following the release of the latest report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the very head of the UN, Antonio Guterres slammed oil and gas. ""This report must sound a death knell for coal and fossil fuels before they destroy our planet,"" he said, adding ""Countries should also end all new fossil fuel exploration and production, and shift fossil fuel subsidies into renewable energy."" Also earlier this year, the International Energy Agency published a roadmap to net zero, in which it called for the end of all new oil and gas exploration. Only a few months later, the IEA called on OPEC to boost new oil and gas exploration in order to ensure an adequate supply of hydrocarbons amid fast-growing demand. The IEA’s contradictory stances are a perfect illustration of how challenging the “simple solution” of turning the oil taps off is in reality. Shell’s chief executive put it succinctly in comments on the historic court ruling that obliged the supermajor to cut its carbon footprint substantially.
  Related: U.S. Oil Industry Warns Of Sharply Higher Costs “Imagine Shell decided to stop selling petrol and diesel today,” Ben van Beurden wrote in a LinkedIn post. “This would certainly cut Shell’s carbon emissions. But it would not help the world one bit. Demand for fuel would not change. People would fill up their cars and delivery trucks at other service stations.” It is the demand side of the hydrocarbon equation that climate activists regularly appear to choose to overlook, focused with laser precision on the production side. When the pandemic started last year, many, including BP, claimed we are already past peak oil demand. As lockdowns eased, however, reality reasserted itself and it turned out that demand for oil has not, in fact, peaked at all. Now, investment banks, the International Energy Agency, and the U.S. Energy Information Administration are all forecasting greater demand still next year. Investment banks are also projecting higher oil prices because they expect demand to be greater than supply after the first quarter. In fact, some are forecasting much higher prices for oil. What this means, aside from market speculation, is that the supply of oil is expected to remain too tight to meet expected demand for most of 2022. What this context suggests for calls to turn off the valve is not exactly a better world, although it would certainly be a lower-emission world, for a while. Global emissions fell last year while hundreds of millions stayed home during the lockdowns. As soon as the lockdowns were over, people got out and emissions began to rise. It is hardly a wonder that the idea surfaced that we needed the equivalent of the 2020 Covid-19 lockdowns in order to cope with emission control.
 This idea may yet gain traction amid activist calls for an end to oil and gas. Activists—and scientists, by the way—warn that the Paris Agreement targets are impossible to achieve with current efforts. In fact, scientists have estimated that we need to put a lot more effort into reducing emissions, halving current levels over the next eight years, in order to have a chance of meeting the Paris Agreement goals and chiefly the goal of reducing the global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. To be fair, the 1.5-degree scenario was until recently commonly referred to as the more ambitious and therefore less likely to succeed scenario. The 2-degree scenario was the one recognized as more within our powers. Now, it appears that the 1.5-degree scenario is the one we should strive for, whatever it takes. And whatever it takes might include national lockdowns and, if activists get heard at a high enough level, cuts in oil and gas production, which, as IHS Markit’s Daniel Yergin warned earlier this year, would lead to more energy crunches like the one currently ravaging Europe. Because demand for energy is going nowhere. In fact, demand for energy on a global scale is set to increase substantially in the coming years. Policy-makers and activists both need to refocus their attention on that part of the hydrocarbon equation.",Neg
US Oil Industry Warns Of Sharply Higher Costs.html,"The U.S. oil industry is facing a sharp increase in production costs, the Dallas Fed energy survey’s latest edition has revealed. The survey found that while activity in the oil patch continued to recover during the fourth quarter and production rose faster, costs also rose, for the third quarter in a row, and they rose sharply. According to the Dallas Fed index, the reading for oil production in the period rose to 19.1 from 10.7 in the third quarter, but the cost input reading also rose, to 69.8 from 60.8 in the third quarter. The fourth-quarter reading is a record high.
 Despite, or perhaps because of higher costs, the industry expects to spend more next year. Some 44 percent of respondents in the survey said they expected to increase capital expenditure slightly, with almost a third saying they expected a significant increase in capital spending in 2022. Only a modest 8 percent said they expected a decline in spending next year. In terms of price expectations, the industry is cautiously optimistic. Asked about what price their companies are using to plan their capital expenditure, almost a third said that was between $65 and $70 per barrel. A smaller portion of about 25 percent said they would be budgeting n the basis of oil prices at $70 to $75 per barrel. U.S. oil companies also have plans to expand production next year. According to 49 percent of respondents in the survey, “grow production” was the primary goal of their companies in 2022. Only 15 percent picked as their primary goal to maintain current production levels. For 13 percent of respondents, reducing debt was the primary goal for 2022.
 Despite rising costs, the six-month outlook for the industry remained upbeat, although the reading for that indicator declined from 58.9 in the third quarter to 53.2 in the fourth quarter.",Neg

3 North American Stocks To Capitalize On Higher Oil Prices.html,"The energy sector is increasingly looking to end the year on a high note after U.S. crude oil managed to overcome an early slump to close above $75/bbl in Monday's trading session. Indeed, oil prices are now trading at their highest level in a month, with Brent crude trading near $80 as Omicron fears continue easing. A new study conducted by South African scientists suggests that Omicron could displace the Delta variant of coronavirus because infection with the new variant boosts immunity to the older one. So far, people who contract Omicron are presenting with milder symptoms than those who get infected with Delta and are also less likely to be hospitalized. Oil stocks are flying again, with the sector's favorite benchmark, the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEARCA:XLE), climbing 2.2% to lead the Santa Claus rally. APA Corp. (NYSE:APA) topped Monday's S&P leaderboard after climbing 7.3% on the day, with Devon Corp.(NYSE:DVN), Diamondback Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:FANG), EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG), Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO), Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) and Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) all making strong gains. With the year drawing to a close, it's time for investors to recalibrate their portfolios. The current year has been an annus mirabilis for energy investors thanks to high energy prices. But the oil markets continue to be volatile and turbulent thanks to the pandemic and the ongoing energy transition. Luckily, Wall Street remains largely bullish on the energy sector, with some analysts predicting even higher oil prices in 2022. Barclays has predicted that the WTI contract price will increase from the current rate of $73 to an average price of $77 in 2022, noting that the Biden administration's sale of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve isn't a sustainable way to bring down prices. Barclays says prices could go even higher than that forecast if COVID-19 outbreaks are minimized and thus allow demand to grow more than expected.  Goldman Sachs shares that bullish outlook and has predicted a Brent price of $85 per barrel by 2023 compared to the current $76.30. Here are our top 3 North American oil stocks for 2022. #1. ConocoPhillips ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is a top shale player that primarily engages in conventional and tight oil reservoirs, shale gas, heavy oil, LNG, oil sands, and other production operations. Last quarter, Bank of America upgraded COP shares to Buy from Neutral with a $67 price target, calling the company a ""cash machine"" with the potential for accelerated returns. According to BofA analyst Doug Leggate, Conoco looks ""poised to accelerate cash returns at an earlier and more significant pace than any 'pure-play' E&P or oil major.""  Leggate COP shares have pulled back to more attractive levels ""but with a different macro outlook from when [Brent] oil peaked close to $70.""  But best of all, the BofA analyst believes COP is highly exposed to a longer-term oil recovery.
 But BofA is not the only Wall Street punter that's gushing about COP. In a note to clients, Raymond James says the company's stock price is undervaluing the flood of cash the oil and gas company is poised to generate. Well, it appears the analysts were right on the money: three weeks ago, Conoco unveiled its preliminary plans for 2022, highlighting a three-tiered program that could see the company return around $7 billion in cash to investors in 2022. COP provides a re-engineered shareholder return plan with:  1) Base dividend of $2.4B (2.5% of market cap)  2) Variable dividend of 20c/s in the coming quarter (1.1% of current market cap, annualized) 3) Share buyback of $3.5B (3.7% of market cap) If sustained, this positions COP shareholders for a 7.3% payout with little production growth. COP is penciling in a 36% increase in capex for the year (22% adjusting for the Permian purchase) but a mere 3% production growth. In effect, Conoco is set to return around $7 billion in cash to investors over the coming year.  The company is also making smart investments, including its $9.5 billion all-cash acquisition of Royal Dutch Shell's (NYSE:RDS.A) Permian Basin assets and also investing about $200 million in green projects to reduce its carbon emissions.  COP shares have returned 83.1% YTD. #2. Cenovus Energy  Canadian Oil Sands oil company Cenovus Energy (NYSE:CVE) develops, produces, and markets crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas in Canada, the United States and the Asia Pacific region. The company operates through Oil Sands, Conventional, and Refining and Marketing segments. Long-suffering Canadian energy stocks are beginning to look like real bargains. CVE shares have shot to a 52-week high after J.P. Morgan upgraded the shares to Overweight from Neutral with a C$14.50 price target (45% potential upside), citing progress on execution of last year's takeover of Husky Energy (OTCPK:HUSKF). Cenovus shares remain undervalued, yet the company is in a great position to generate enough free cash flow to buy back its ConocoPhillips' stake.
 Last week, Cenovus released 2022e guidance and a 5-year outlook. The company said that at $75 WTI price, it would be able to generate ""excess free cash flow"" of $33B over the next 5yrs, or around 100% of the company's current market cap. More immediately, Cenovus plans to generate $5.5B of excess free cash flow in 2022 (16% of the company's current market cap) and will allocate 50%+ to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. Cenovus management is currently authorized to repurchase ~146M shares or ~7% of shares outstanding. Over the 5-year forecast horizon, CVE plans to maintain 800kb/d of upstream production (up 4% vs 2021, but flat from 2022e onwards). Perhaps most importantly, and opposite the Company's 2019 capital markets mishaps, Cenovus plans to reduce capital expenditures over the forecast period (while sustaining production and increasing shareholder returns). CVE shares have gained 106.6% YTD. #3. APA Corp. Shares of APA Corp. (NYSE:APA) have been surging after the company signed an agreement with the Egyptian government to invest at least $3.5B on research, development, and production in the country's Western Desert. According to APA's management, the deal consolidates 90% of gross production into a single concession and also refreshes existing development lease terms for 20 years. Just last month, Egypt's parliament approved an agreement to modernize and consolidate its production sharing contracts with the government. APA's joint venture with China's Sinopec is projected to increase gross capital investment by $235M in Egypt during 2022 and boost Egypt's gross oil production by 13-15%. The company says the joint venture will be entitled to recover nearly $900M of backlogged costs over five years starting from April 1, 2021. Last year, APA announced a major oil discovery at its 1.4-million-acre offshore Suriname tract adjacent to Exxon Mobil Corp.'s (NYSE: XOM) historic discovery. APA said it has made a world-class discovery at the Kwaskwasi-1 well located in the prolific Guyana-Suriname Basin, where it encountered 278 meters (912 feet) of net oil and volatile oil / gas condensate pay. Bank of America Merrill Lynch touted the Suriname prospect as a potential game-changer for APA: ""Suriname has the potential to reset the investment case,"" Merrill Lynch's veteran oil-industry analyst Doug Leggate said. APA shares have gained 97.1% YTD.",Pos
Oil Perks Up With Another Crude Inventory Draw.html,"Crude oil prices recovered on Wednesday morning despite word from the Energy Information Administration of an inventory draw of 3.6 million barrels for the week to December 24. At 420 million barrels, crude oil inventories remain 7% below the five-year average—compared to 8% below the five-year average last week. On Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute estimated a crude oil inventory draw of 3.09 million barrels for the week to December 24. In gasoline, the API reported a draw of 319,000 barrels, with a decline of 716,000 in distillates.
 Gasoline inventories decreased by 1.5 million barrels in the reporting period, according to the EIA, which compared with a build of 5.5 million barrels for the previous week. Gasoline production increased last week, averaging 10.1 million bpd, compared with 9.9 million bpd in the previous week. In middle distillates, the EIA estimated an inventory draw of 1.7 million barrels for the week to December 24, which compared with an increase of 400,000 barrels for the previous week. Middle distillate production increased last week, averaging 4.9 million barrels per day, which compared with 4.9 million bpd in the prior week.

Heres Why OPEC Didnt Respond To US Calls For More Oil.html,"An ambition to provide the global oil market with clear guidance on future production plans and discipline in sticking to already agreed policies is the reason OPEC+ did not respond to U.S. calls to boost oil production, Russia’s Deputy PM and top OPEC+ negotiator Alexander Novak said. In an interview with news outlet RBC, Novak explained that it was more important for the extended cartel to indicate how much oil it will be producing in the medium term as demand increases rather than boosting output in the near term in response to a large consumer’s call. “We cannot secure fluctuating production,” Novak said. “Oil production companies must plan their investments ahead of time in order to secure production growth,” he added, noting that during the winter, there is usually a decline in the demand for oil.
 ‘For some reason,” the official said, “The U.S. is not asking its own shale oil companies to boost production, which has fallen considerably over the last two years. On the contrary, they are deliberately reducing their production. I believe there is a certain contradiction in these actions.”  U.S. President Joe Biden called on OPEC+ repeatedly to boost production by more than 400,000 bpd because prices at the pump were becoming too high for American drivers. When the calls failed to produce a response, Biden blamed OPEC+ for hurting poor working American families. This failed to work, too, which is when the Biden administration announced a release of up to 50 million barrels from the strategic petroleum reserve.
 The news has served to moderate prices, especially as it coincided with the news of the emergence of the omicron variant, which prompted worry about new movement restrictions that would, as usual, hurt oil demand. Novak, like many observers, downplayed the effect of the SPR release along with the planned releases of other countries. “Plans are for a total release of 50-60 million barrels,” he told RBC. “Of this, the U.S. will release about 30 million barrels in January and February. But the world consumes 36 billion barrels annually,” he explained, noting that in this context, the release of 50 or 60 million barrels will have only a temporary effect.",Neutral
Global Oil Demand Could Reach New Heights In 2022.html,"Oil demand suffered a severe blow last year when the initially ignored coronavirus in China spread around the world and started prompting lockdowns. Then the wave receded, and oil demand began to rebound, much faster than most expected. Despite the green transition push, demand will continue to recover into next year, too, and those after it. Many forecasters, including BP, in 2020 argued that peak oil was already past us and what we had to look forward to was a more renewable energy mix. And then Covid-19 case numbers in key markets began to decline, and oil demand began to rise. Since then, demand has rebounded so strongly that it has led forecasts to start warning of the possibility of a shortage. Saudi Arabia recently warned that underinvestment in new oil and gas production would lead to higher prices and supply crunches. ""We're heading toward a phase that could be dangerous if there's not enough spending on energy,"" the Kingdom's Energy Minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said earlier this month. Insufficient investment could lead to an ""energy crisis,"" he added.  Banks are contributing to the discrepancy between demand forecasts and supply realities as they feel growing pressure to stop doing business with the oil and gas industry because of its carbon footprint. This may well exacerbate the energy crunch if such a crunch is indeed in the cards. It probably is. Investment bank analysts seem to overwhelmingly expect higher prices because of strong demand and not-so-strong supply. Goldman Sachs' Damien Courvalin said earlier this month Brent crude could hit $100 next year. Morgan Stanley analysts slashed their first-quarter 2022 outlook for oil, citing omicron concerns but raised their third-quarter forecast to $90 per barrel of Brent, from $85 per barrel. Canada's BMO Markets expects oil demand to hit a record next year and remain strong over the next few years as well despite a temporary dip in the first quarter, again because of the omicron variant of the coronavirus.
 Speaking of omicron, OPEC has largely brushed off what others see as a new threat for global economies and oil demand. The cartel, in its latest Monthly Oil Market Report actually raised its demand forecast for the first quarter of next year, despite planned reserve releases by the United States, Japan, and South Korea, aimed at curbing the rally in oil prices that started in late 2020 and pushed benchmarks to highs of over $80 per barrel in October. According to the cartel, the effect of omicron on oil demand will be ""mild and short-lived, as the world becomes better equipped to manage COVID-19 and its related challenges.""  Related: Cocaine, Guns And Gushers: Colombia’s Oil Industry Struggles To Reactivate Goldman's Courvalin appears to agree with this view. ""If this is another wave like the ones we've seen before then it is a negative hit to economic growth in the first quarter of 2022,"" he said recently, as quoted by Reuters. ""But if there is a subsequent recovery, oil demand, which briefly touched pre-COVID levels in early November, would then be at new record highs for most of 2022."" If the previous Covid-19 waves are any indication, there will be a recovery after this wave, too. A potential problem would be the ability of suppliers to satisfy this demand beyond the short term. Investments in new oil production have indeed declined considerably, and many in the industry—chiefly the supermajors—are still wary of splashing on more oil and gas, so they splash instead on renewable power capacity.  
 This may play them a bad joke down the road, however. If the European energy crisis has taught us anything, it is the unpleasant fact that even green and sustainable Europe is still heavily dependent on fossil fuels. And Europe is not among the top consumers of oil—it's emerging Asia that has this pleasure, and all forecasts point towards this demand growing further in the coming years. OPEC+'s spare capacity stood at 5.11 million bpd as of October this year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. However, spare capacity is not static, and the October figure is actually a substantial decline from the start of 2021 when spare capacity in the extended cartel stood at 9 million bpd. And it could fall further to less than 4 million bpd by the end of next year. This state of affairs prompted the International Energy Agency, a vocal proponent of the energy transition, to urge more investments in new oil production. Just how serious the situation could become because of this discrepancy shows in the fact that just months earlier, the IEA had called for an end to all new oil and gas investments so the world can reach its net-zero targets. So it appears that next year will see even stronger oil demand, even with a temporary dip during the first quarter while we come to terms with the omicron variant. And while demand grows stronger, supply growth will continue to lag behind under ESG investor and government pressure. Oil markets are certainly in for an interesting year in 2022.",Pos
A Look At Big Oils Spending Plans For 2022.html,"The global upstream sector is set for a rebound next year, when overall investment in exploration and production is expected to exceed $400 billion for the first time in three years.  Yet, despite record high cash flows and oil at over $70 a barrel, reinvestment rates will stay at near record low levels in 2022, as companies will maintain discipline in spending and pay more attention to climate and shareholder pressure to decarbonize operations, Wood Mackenzie said in its Global Upstream Outlook 2022 report.    After a year of recovery in 2021, following the crash and crisis of 2020, the oil and gas industry is generating record or near record cash flows these days.  Capital Discipline Prevails  However, cash flows are being allocated to higher shareholder payouts in the form of share buybacks and raised dividends instead of significant increases in drilling activity. It’s nothing new for Big Oil to use high cash flows to repurchase shares and boost dividends. This year has shown that the U.S. shale patch has also pivoted to returns for investors and has abandoned the relentless drilling and investing all the cash flows (and even borrowing to invest) in new wells.   Shale-focused U.S. producers, as well as international majors and national oil companies (NOCs), continue to be careful with upstream spending, even if oil prices have held above $70 per barrel for most of the past six months.  According to Wood Mackenzie, capital discipline will still be a major theme in upstream oil and gas in 2022. Total global upstream investment is set to increase by 9 percent to over $400 billion next year.  This will be the first time that overall upstream spending will have exceeded $400 billion annually for the first time since 2019. 
 Despite the expected higher investment next year, the global reinvestment rate – calculated as capital investment divided by pre-dividend post-tax operating cash flow – will stay near record lows, according to WoodMac.  Among Big Oil, no one is splurging on investment these days, unlike in the years prior to the 2015 price crash, when companies were spending as if oil would stay at $100 a barrel forever.    Related: Canada And The UK Are Eyeing Massive Tidal Power Developments Sure, capex for 2022 is set to be higher at all five majors – ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell, BP, and TotalEnergies – compared to 2021 and 2020, but it’s nowhere near 2014 levels. Capital discipline is still the keyword in all earnings releases and calls, where higher dividends and share buybacks take precedence when it comes to allocating record cash flows. The five largest international firms are also raising capital spending on low-carbon energy, including the U.S. supermajors who differ from their European competitors in strategy by not being willing to invest in any solar and wind power generation. Instead, Exxon and Chevron plan to focus on renewable fuels and carbon capture and storage (CCS), both to cut their own carbon footprint and to develop in partnership regional CCS hubs in heavily industrialized areas. Industry Cash Flows Could Reach $1 Trillion In 2022  “At a Brent price of around US$70/bbl, oil and gas cash flows will be at near-record levels. At US$80/bbl, it would soar towards US$1 trillion (on a post-tax, post-capex, pre-financing and dividends basis),” Fraser McKay, Vice President, upstream research, at Wood Mackenzie, says.  Despite record cash flows, the oil and gas sector faces ‘peak uncertainty’ next year amid climate and shareholder pressure, WoodMac says. The industry faces increased pressure to reduce emissions and show investors it could be part of the solution – not the problem – in the global drive toward decarbonization.  Related: Saudi Arabia Doubles Down On Asian Demand 
 Although cash flows could hit records next year, “for many stakeholders and even some chief executives, the sector’s risks outweigh its upsides. This tension will define 2022,” according to Wood Mackenzie’s McKay.  Uncertainties Mount Strategic choices in investment in clean energy solutions, responding to the pressure to decarbonize, and portfolio repositioning will be next year’s key themes for all oil and gas companies—from the supermajors and the NOCs to the U.S. independent oil and gas producers, Tom Ellacott, Senior Vice President, Corporate Research, at Wood Mackenzie, wrote in a recent report with an outlook of what to expect in 2022.  “Companies will allocate more capital to upstream decarbonisation. Value accretive solutions, which increase product sales, will continue to lead the way, but CCS projects will gain momentum and attract new participants,” Wood Mackenzie’s McKay said in WoodMac’s Global Upstream Outlook 2022.  The energy research firm expects operators to sanction in 2022 more than 40 projects over 50 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) each, with low-breakeven, low-carbon deepwater projects dominating greenfield final investment decisions (FIDs).  The upstream oil and gas industry is set for a rebound next year, but overall investment of $400 billion will still lag the needed around $540 billion to stave off a supply shortage within a few years’ time. In addition, the pressure to decarbonize would also shape the industry’s future investment choices, both in 2022 and in the long run. ",Neutral
Saudi Exports Surge On Higher Oil Prices.html,"Saudi exports surged in October on the back of higher oil prices, which hit a 2021 peak during that month. Saudi Arabia exported goods and commodities worth a total $28 billion in October, according to the Kingdom’s General Authority for Statistics, as cited by Bloomberg. Crude oil accounted for 77.6 percent of total exports in that month, up from 66.1 percent a year earlier. The value of total exports was almost double that for October 2020. The value of oil exports alone was 123 percent higher in October 2021 from a year ago, the statistics authority also said, while the value of non-oil exports rose by 25.5 percent.
 One of the world’s top oil exporters has reaped the full benefits of recovering demand for oil this year, upping both its exports and selling prices, despite lingering worries about the pandemic. Even as the latest coronavirus variant caused fears of new lockdowns and other restrictions, Saudi Arabia raised its official selling prices for oil for Asian buyers and by a hefty $0.60 per barrel. The decision to hike prices demonstrates confidence that demand for oil will remain robust despite the pandemic. The confidence was also highlighted earlier this month when OPEC+ decided to add another 400,000 bpd to combined production in January despite the U.S. administration’s decision to release up to 50 million barrels of crude in a bid to lower retail fuel prices.
 Thanks to higher oil prices, the Kingdom’s Finane Minister said earlier this month it expected to book its first budget surplus in a decade next year. Despite the contribution of oil to this forecast performance of the Saudi economy, the Kingdom will remain on its diversification course, Al-Jadaan also said, and it will also remain disciplined about public spending. For this year, the ministry of finance expects GDP growth of 2.9 percent, to rise to 7.4 percent in 2022.",Pos
Cocaine Guns And Gushers Colombias Oil Industry Struggles To Reactivate.html,"Despite the groundbreaking 2016 peace deal between the Colombian government and the largest guerilla group the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC – Spanish initials) there are fears that conflict is escalating once again. Colombia, which is Latin America’s third-largest petroleum producer and the world’s largest manufacturer of cocaine for nearly a century, has been caught in a simmering low-intensity asymmetric conflict that reached boiling point during the 1980s. The primary flashpoint for the civil conflict, which currently engulfs Colombia and failed to end with the 2016 FARC peace accord was the April 1948 assassination of Liberal Party leader Jorge Gaitan in Bogota. That sparked the Bogotazo, days of violent rioting that swept across Bogota resulting in up to 3,000 deaths, which eventually evolved into a vicious 10-year civil war between the Colombian Liberal and Conservative parties known as La Violencia. While that brutal struggle ended in a 1958 power-sharing agreement between Colombia’s leading political parties, it sowed the seeds for the current low-intensity multiparty asymmetric conflict.  In 1964 the Colombian Communist Party formed the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC – Spanish initials) after a military attack on the community of Marquetalia, a Communist peasant enclave established during the of La Violencia. That event saw the communist FARC emerge as the most powerful left-wing anti-government armed group during the conflict. The guerillas eventually cut ties with the Colombian Communist Party and increasingly relied upon kidnapping, extortion, and cocaine trafficking to fund their operations. Prior to these events, which cast Colombia into what appears to be a never-ending low-intensity asymmetric multiparty civil conflict, oil was discovered in 1918 at the La Cira-Infantas field in the Middle Magdalena Basin near the city of Barrancabermeja. Even after additional petroleum discoveries in the Middle Magdalena Basin, it was not until the giant Caño Limon, Cusiana, and Cupiagua oilfields were discovered between 1983 and 1993 that Colombia embarked on becoming a major oil producer. Those mega discoveries and a notable increase in foreign energy investment, as well as petroleum production, occurred despite violence surging because of the tremendous influx of profits from the booming cocaine trade. Even the tremendous escalation of violence, homicides, kidnappings, and attacks on energy infrastructure which escalated in the late-1980s, lasting well into the early 21st century, had little material impact on Colombia’s hydrocarbon sector. By 1991 Colombia was pumping over 400,000 barrels per day, more than double its output in 1985, despite becoming the world’s murder capital with a homicide rate of 84 intentional killings per 100,000 people. That was more than eight times greater than the U.S. which reported 9.8 homicides per 100,000 head of population, 7-times higher than neighboring Venezuela’s murder rate of 12 and 8-times larger than Ecuador’s 11 homicides per 100,000 people. Heightened insecurity and violence remained a persistent problem in Colombia, even after the collapse of the Medellin and Cali cartels, as the FARC and National Liberation Army ELN (Spanish initials) ramped-up operations as vast revenue flowed in from the drug trade. By 2000, after President Andres Pastrana’s peace negotiations with the FARC had failed, the leftist guerillas controlled a 42,000 square mile territory in southeastern Colombia and kidnappings had surged to a record high of 3,500 for the year. Even those events failed to have any material impact on Colombia’s oil boom. A combination of soaring oil prices and rapidly improving internal security during the early 2000s, because of Plan Colombia and President Alvaro Uribe’s military campaign against the FARC, saw foreign energy investment and hence crude oil production growth.
 During 2003 when Brent averaged $28.83 per barrel, a 15% increase over 2002, Colombia pumped an average of 550,000 barrels of crude oil per day. When Brent had soared to over $140 per barrel during 2008, annual petroleum production averaged 600,000 barrels daily and kept growing to peak at a yearly record of just over 1 million barrels per day by 2013. Since 2016 Colombia’s petroleum output has been in terminal decline impacted at first by the late-2014 oil price crash, sharply rising violence, and finally because of the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. Even the 2017 demobilization of the largest leftist guerilla group the FARC, after a 2016 peace agreement was struck with the government of President Juan Manuel Santos, has done little if anything to arrest Colombia’s production decline. That in part can be blamed on current President Ivan Duque’s reluctance to fully implement the peace deal, contributing to an increase in violence and civil unrest in regional Colombia.  Related: Southeast Asia’s Oil And Gas Output May Never Recover To Pre-COVID Levels During 2020, the crisis-driven Andean nation only pumped on average 781,300 barrels of crude oil per day as the COVID-19 pandemic, related national quarantine lockdown and sharply weaker oil prices impacted investment as well as production. More worrying, is that despite the pandemic lockdown ending by September 2020 and energy investment increasing, average petroleum output only reached 734,231 barrels per day for the first 10 months of 2021 which is 6% less than the full year 2020. That disappointing decline occurred because of heightened civil unrest with anti-government protests sweeping across Colombia during late- April 2021 lasting into May and early-June 2021. Falling crude oil output can also be attributed to rising insecurity in regional areas, where petroleum industry operations are concentrated, fueled by a marked uptick in violence related to the activities of illegal armed groups and cocaine production.
 It is the cocaine trade that is an enduring problem for Colombia. The tremendous profits that the trade generates are responsible for fueling what is a near-perpetual low-level asymmetric conflict where only the illegal armed actors change as the various groups fragment and reform. Estimates vary, but Colombia’s government believes the civil conflict has claimed up to 260,000 lives and displaced at least 9 million people. According to the UN Colombia’s cocaine production during 2020 increased by 8% compared to a year earlier, despite a 7% decrease in the volume of land used for coca cropping and an 18% increase in seizures. The scale of massive profits generated by cocaine is highlighted by former finance minister Juan Carlos Echeverry’s estimate (Spanish) that the drug trade generates $8 to $12 billion annually, which is equivalent to 5 to 4% of Colombia’s gross domestic product. Using Echeverry’s numbers the cocaine trade is contributing the same amount, if not more, to Colombia’s GDP than the oil industry which based on DANE data (Spanish) for the first 3 quarters of 2021 was responsible for 3% of GDP. Rising security risk and rural violence, which is mostly fueled by the vast profits generated by the cocaine trade, is a key deterrent to attracting onshore oil investment in Colombia. A combination of security risks and mature assets saw Occidental Petroleum, in October 2020, sell its Colombian onshore petroleum assets in an $825 million deal, although the company retained its offshore exploration blocks. Despite the risks associated with operating in onshore Colombia, the Andean country’s 2021 bid round found some success. Seven companies made offers for 30 of the 53 blocks (Spanish) on offer with initial investment expected to exceed $148 million. Five of the offers came from national oil company Ecopetrol or its subsidiaries and 21 from intermediate energy companies with existing operational presence in Colombia, Parex Resources, Frontera Energy, and Canacol Energy. This indicates that Colombia is struggling to attract foreign onshore energy investment because of the heightened security risks coupled with high breakeven prices and elevated carbon content of the sour heavy crude oil produced.",Neutral
Southeast Asias Oil And Gas Output May Never Recover To Pre COVID Levels.html,"  The Covid-19 pandemic has marked the end of an era for Southeast Asia’s combined oil and gas production, pushing the region’s output in 2021 to below 5 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) for the first time since 1998, a threshold that is not likely to be exceeded again in the future despite new project start-ups in coming years, a Rystad Energy analysis shows.   Daily average hydrocarbon production tumbled to 4.86 million boepd in 2021, down from 5.06 million boepd in 2020, and a massive 12% drop compared to the pre-pandemic volumes of 5.5 million boepd in 2019, Rystad Energy data shows. Operators have struggled to regain production losses triggered by the pandemic as operators slowed down activity levels amid an unprecedented disruption in oil markets. The decline is projected to continue into the middle of the decade. Although volumes will remain stable in 2022, production will drop an additional 10% by 2025 to around 4.3 million boepd versus current levels. “Liquids production in Southeast Asia has been on the decline for almost 20 years due to a lack of discoveries and project sanctioning activities in the region. While new government incentives may help, the region looks set to experience declining production levels well into the future,” says Prateek Pandey, upstream vice president  By contrast, natural gas production in the region stayed steady between 2009 and 2019, at around 20.8 billion cubic feet per day (Bcfd). Despite expectations of a rise in gas sales volume that would counter the 8% fall in production in 2020, volumes are expected to be down around 2% this year compared to 2020, at about 19 Bcfd. This is primarily due to falling production at mature legacy projects including Mahakam, MLNG Dua and MLNG Satu PSCs, Yetagun. 
 The share of volume from projects under development and existing commercial discoveries are substantial and reflect the region’s timely execution of projects. Several projects were successfully brought onstream in 2021, including the highly anticipated Rotan field, utilizing PFLNG Dua, which started in March, making Petronas the only operator globally to produce LNG from two floating facilities. In Indonesia, Eni completed a timely development, with Merakes achieving its first gas production in April 2021  Related: Energy Groups Call For Government Intervention As Power Prices Skyrocket However, despite these successes, Southeast Asia is still plagued by delays and stalled projects. In Indonesia, a recovery in gas production has been further delayed after the two significant developments -Tangguh LNG T3 and Jambaran Tiung-Biru Unitisation (JTB) - were postponed until 2022. What the future holds For most of Southeast Asia, over 60% of output comes from mature blocks – fields producing more than 50% of its resource. Volumes from such blocks are likely to see a consistent decline over the next few years, with an estimated 60% of production by 2030 likely coming from projects currently at the pre-FID (final investment decision) stage. Consequently, the driving force behind the region’s upstream outlook will be the sanctioning of new developments. 2020 was a nightmare year for regional sanctioning activity, with only around 300 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) of resources from six assets reaching FIDs. As operators tried to move forward in 2021, the region has seen more than ten projects secure FIDs, with around 750 million boe of reserves and some $3 billion in greenfield investment, with Malaysia accounting for 85% of the total.
 Sanctioning activities in 2022 are likely to remain at similar levels, with FIDs planned on around 800 million boe of resources in the region, of which 60% are in Indonesia and over 35% in Malaysia. Projects operated by majors and NOCs are likely to dominate in Malaysia, whereas regional players and E&P companies will primarily drive Indonesian developments. However, planned FID projects in 2022 may still face challenges in securing the final approval.  Indonesia’s domestic gas price regulation remains a concern for most large gas developments in the pipeline. Although incentives are being discussed for blocks such as Kasuri, it is still one of the factors that could further delay progress. The planned developments from production sharing contracts (PSC) due for current contract expiry in the near term are also at risk unless host country governments initiate early discussions on potential extensions. Southeast Asia is unlikely to see a substantial increase in spending in 2022, with investments projected to be in the range of $15 billion to $20 billion across the year. Investments will likely be driven by increased drilling activity in mature blocks in Indonesia and Thailand, as NOCs take the reins and focus on top-producing blocks. Around 360 million boe in resources have been discovered at eight fields as of November 2021, surpassing 2020 volumes by 40%. About 78% of total discovered resources this year in Southeast Asia are gas or gas condensate, while the remainder is oil. About 84% come from shallow waters, with around 86% at NOC-operated blocks. In line with the trend, over 90% of volume in the region in 2021 has been discovered in the Miocene-Clastic formation.",Neg
South Korea To Release 3 Million Barrels Of Oil Reserves In Early 2022.html,"South Korea will release 3.17 million barrels of its oil reserves in the first quarter of 2022 as part of the U.S.-led global effort by major oil-consuming nations to lower prices.   The volume to be released between January and March accounts for 3.3 percent of South Korea’s state oil reserves of 97 million barrels, according to the ministry of trade, industry and energy (Motie) cited by Argus. Just over 2 million barrels of the release will be crude and will go to local refiners via loan agreements, and the other 1.09 million barrels will be petroleum products released via a bidding process to the highest bidder, South Korea said.   
 U.S. President Joe Biden said at the end of November that the Department of Energy would release 50 million barrels of oil from the SPR in a bid to lower high gasoline prices in a coordinated effort with other major oil-consuming nations. The SPR release from the United States will be carried out in parallel with other major energy-consuming nations, including China, India, Japan, South Korea, and the UK.  Despite the seemingly big number, 50 million barrels, the U.S. release actually equals around two and a half days of American petroleum consumption, which was at 20.5 million barrels per day (bpd) in the pre-pandemic 2019.
 The other countries are going for much smaller releases, and the message seems to be that major oil consumers are coordinating efforts to try to lower high prices, while OPEC+ sticks to its guns over its oil production plan.   The oil market had already largely priced in SPR releases, with prices sliding before the official announcement. Analysts have also pointed out that one-off sales from strategic reserves cannot do much to move oil prices significantly lower.  What did move oil prices lower was the emergence of the Omicron COVID variant, which spooked the markets jut after Thanksgiving, leading to a 10-percent price collapse on the following day. Crude oil led the plunge in all markets as countries started to announce bans on flights from African countries. The low liquidity on the oil market in the festive period in the U.S. also contributed to the collapse in prices, which was the largest one-day crash since April 2020.",Pos
Oil Prices Jumps On Large Crude Draw As Markets Ignore Gasoline Build.html,"Crude oil prices recovered on Wednesday morning despite word from the Energy Information Administration of an inventory draw of 4.7 million barrels for the week to December 17. At 423.6 million barrels, crude oil inventories remain 8% below the five-year average—compared to 7% below the five-year average last week. Last week’s draw adds to last week’s huge draw of 4.6 million barrels from crude oil inventories. On Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute estimated a crude oil inventory draw of 3.670 million barrels for the week to December 17.
 In gasoline, the API reported a build of 3.7 million barrels, with a decline of 849,000 in distillates. Gasoline inventories increased by 5.5 million barrels in the reporting period according to the EIA, which compared with a draw of 700,000 barrels for the previous week. Gasoline production decreased last week, averaging 9.9 million bpd, compared with 10.0 million bpd in the previous week. In middle distillates, the EIA estimated an inventory build of 400,000 barrels for the week to December 17, which compared with a decrease of 2.9 million barrels for the previous week.
 Middle distillate production increased last week, averaging 4.9 million barrels per day, which compared with 4.8 million bpd in the prior week. Oil prices have been pressured by pandemic concerns courtesy of the Omicron variant that has triggered another round of restrictions in certain countries. At 10:12 a.m. EDT, crude oil prices were trading up on the day, with WTI crude trading at $71.35, up $0.23 (.32%), and Brent crude trading at $74.20, up $0.22 per barrel (0.30%).

Colombia May Lose Energy Independence As Crude Production Falls.html,"Colombia, Latin America’s third-largest oil producer after Brazil and Mexico, is in danger of losing its energy self-sufficiency and a significant part of its gross domestic product (GDP) in the future, unless the pace of exploration accelerates, a Rystad Energy report has revealed. The country’s oil and gas output along with its total proven reserves tally are in decline, while investments will likely fail to recover to pre-Covid-19 pandemic levels this decade. Crude oil production in Colombia this year is on track to hit its lowest level since 2009, currently averaging at just over 730,000 barrels per day (bpd), down from 754,000 bpd in 2020, which was already an 11-year low, Rystad Energy data shows. Amid a lack of discoveries, meanwhile, the country’s proven crude reserves as of the end of 2020 stood at 1.82 billion barrels, a three-year low and a far cry from the 2.45 billion barrels recorded in 2013 when the country was flexing its muscles against regional peers. While natural gas output in Colombia has been largely flat since 2016, averaging just over 1.07 billion cubic feet per day so far this year – which is a 2.7% rise against 2020 – it is well below the highs of the previous decade. Its proven gas reserves, in contrast, have been on a continuous decline since 2012, ending 2020 at just 2.95 trillion cubic feet (Tcf), nearly half the 5.73 Tcf recorded in 2012. Rystad Energy’s outlook shows that brownfield and greenfield investments on existing discoveries – despite a very marginal uptick expected in the next two years compared with this year’s five-year low of $2.3 billion – are set to drop to below $1.7 billion in both 2024 and 2025, the lowest level in Colombia’s modern oil and gas history. In the second part of the decade – and thanks to an expected mild growth in greenfield investments – the combined spending will rise slightly but never exceed last year’s $2.6 billion, let alone the pre-pandemic level of $3.7 billion in 2019. 
 “Colombia is in urgent need of additional investments and exploration success as proven resources have dwindled. It must double these resources in the next decade to continue to be energy self-sufficient. Although its exploration sector stayed dormant in recent years, there is some hope from wildcats following a recent acreage offering,” says Sofia Forestieri, upstream analyst at Rystad Energy.  Colombia’s hydrocarbon sector is a key revenue generator for the country’s economy, representing 12% of GDP. The industry has, however, struggled in the last few years with declining production and conflict zones being located in some of the territory’s most oil-rich regions, such as Catatumbo, which is estimated to hold 17 million barrels of unexplored oil reserves. Colombia is the third-largest crude oil producer in Latin America, representing about 10% of the region’s total production in the last decade. Output rose from 525,000 bpd in 2007 to close to 990,000 bpd in 2013. Since then, it has continuously declined, reaching a record monthly low of 694,100 bpd in June and averaging 733,600 bpd in the first nine months of 2021 – 7% lower than the comparable period last year. Some hope on the horizon
 Exploration expenditure offshore Colombia, which reached over $600 million in 2015 and over $500 million in 2017, has plunged since then, only managing $145 million this year. Nevertheless, a mild uptick is expected, and in 2023 exploration spending is forecast to inch over $200 million for the first time in six years. On the upside, 2021 numbers reflect rising industry interest in the country, with Shell’s farm-in at Ecopetrol’s Fuerte Sur, COL-5 and Purple Angel deepwater blocks in the Colombian Caribbean and Shell’s announcement of an appraisal drilling program for early 2022 offering hope. Apart from this, Anadarko Colombia – an Occidental Petroleum subsidiary – also has four new offshore exploration and production contracts in the La Guajira, Magdalena and Atlantico provinces, while Noble Energy plans to drill a wildcat in the COL-3 Block off La Guarija. Together, these projects could mark the revival of an area where activity was once thwarted because of high development costs. Last but not least, a positive response to Colombia’s fourth round of the Permanent Process for the Assignment of Areas (PPAA), held on 1 December 2021, could provide much-needed impetus to the country’s dormant exploration sector. The auction saw 30 blocks of the 53 offered receive valid bids from seven participating companies, a significant uptick compared to the third round held last year. Additionally, the government secured over $148.5 million in initial investments. Any announcement of new finds within these blocks will not only help increase the country’s hydrocarbons production, thereby benefiting national revenue, it will also instill confidence among investors and could have a significant positive impact on any future bid rounds.",Neg
Global Oil And Gas Discoveries Set To Hit 75 Year Low In 2021.html,"Global oil and gas discoveries in 2021 are on track to hit their lowest full-year level in 75 years should the remainder of December fail to yield any significant finds, Rystad Energy analysis shows. As of the end of November, total global discovered volumes this year are calculated at 4.7 billion barrels of oil equivalent (boe) and, with no major finds announced so far this month, the industry is on course for its worst discoveries toll since 1946. This would also represent a considerable drop from the 12.5 billion boe unearthed in 2020. Liquids continue to dominate the hydrocarbon mix, making up 66% of total finds. Seven new discoveries were announced in November 2021, unearthing around 219 million boe of new volumes. The monthly average of discovered volumes this year now stands at 424 million boe. A reduction in cumulative volume highlights the absence of large individual finds, as has been the case in previous years. “Although some of the highly ranked prospects are scheduled to be drilled before the end of the year, even a substantial discovery may not be able to contribute towards 2021 discovered volumes as these wells may not be completed in this calendar year. Therefore, the cumulative discovered volume for 2021 is on course to be its lowest in decades,” says Palzor Shenga, vice president of upstream research at Rystad Energy.
  The largest discovery in November 2021 was Russian group Lukoil’s Yoti West off the coast of Mexico, which is estimated to hold around 75 million boe of recoverable resources. The discovery strengthens Lukoil’s cumulative discovered volumes in the North American nation. However, these volumes are still insufficient for commercial development and would require further discoveries of a comparable scale before a development concept could be drawn up. These discoveries do, however, give hope to Mexico that the country can halt or slow down its production decline. Several wells are scheduled to be drilled in blocks offered in various bid rounds, many by leading international oil companies. Offshore Malaysia, Nangka-1 became the second successive exploration well drilled within Block SK 417. The wildcat was drilled by Thai state operator PTTEP to a depth of 3,758 meters and discovered sweet gas within the Middle to Late Miocene Cycle VI clastic reservoirs.
 Norway continues to unearth small-to-medium finds, providing an opportunity to materialize these discoveries with available infrastructure.",Neg
US Gasoline And Crude Oil Prices Slide Before The Holidays.html,"U.S. gasoline prices have fallen for the sixth week in a row, falling 2.9 cents from a week ago, according to a Gas Buddy report published Monday. A gallon of gasoline fell to $3.30 per gallon on Monday, Gas Buddy’s survey of more than 11 million gas stations showed. Gasoline prices are still up 50% from a year ago, but are down 22 .1 cents per gallon from a month ago.
 “For yet another week, average gasoline prices continue to fall as omicron cases surge, leading oil demand, and thus oil prices, to stall. The decline in gas prices will likely continue until new Covid cases slow down,” Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis for Gas Buddy, said. But gasoline demand isn’t stalling. U.S. retail gasoline demand rose last week ending December 18, up 2.9% from the week prior. “Beyond Christmas,” De Haan added, “with omicron cases likely to continue climbing, I do believe we’ll see a more noticeable hit on gasoline demand once the holidays are over. There’s a rising likelihood that we won’t see gas prices rising for the rest of the year- with one caveat- gas prices in the Great Lakes states have plummeted by 30 to 50 cents in some areas, and stations in those areas may raise prices slightly should oil prices slow their decline. Aside from those areas, declines at the pump are likely to continue as we close out 2021.”
 But oil price declines are not slowing. The price of crude oil fell spectacularly on Monday, with WTI slipping by nearly 6%, while Brent crude slipped by nearly 5%. At 11:00 a.m., EST, WTI was trading at $66.69 per gallon, down $4.17 (-5.88%) on the day. Brent crude was trading at $69.96, down $3.52 (-4.79%) on the day. Pressuring crude oil prices is the specter of the global effects to limit the spread of the latest Covid variant, Omicron. Already several European states have issued fresh lockdowns in response to Omicron, sparking worry that this may strip away some of the oil demand that has been regained in the last few months.",Neg
Libya Once Again Tries To Boost Oil Production.html,"Libya is considering a reward-and-penalties system for oil companies in order to motivate them to meet production targets. Per a report by Bloomberg, the plan includes introducing new contracts for private companies, under which the companies will stand to receive bonus payments if they meet their targets and be penalized if they fail to do so. The ultimate goal is to boost the country's crude oil production to 1.4 million bpd by the middle of next year. According to oil minister Mohamed Oun, this production level will be possible to achieve if parliament passes the national budget that will provide financing for the oil sector for next year.
 In case Libya fails to pass a national budget with enough money for the oil industry, it would use oil service agreements with private local and international companies to try and boost its production, the official also said. Libya is currently producing 1.25-1.3 million bpd, the country's oil minister told Bloomberg, adding that ""If the state is stabilized through elections or the forming of a government, we hope to reach 2.1 million barrels within two or three years."" The troubled North African country has struggled with a challenging political situation that has affected its oil sector, but it has managed to boost production to over 1 million bpd from a few hundred thousand bpd in a relatively short time. The latest political trouble has come from a spat between the National Oil Corporation and the new government, which led to the suspension of NOC's chairman, Mustafa Sanalla, from his post not once, but twice.
 Before the last suspension, in October, Sanalla boasted a revenue windfall thanks to the oil price rally, saying, ""Everyone is happy. Production rates are wonderful, and the price boom is an important and encouraging sign. We expect a significant reduction in the deficit that the public budget has suffered for the last years, and we are optimistic that financial stability will contribute to creating an investment environment, especially in the infrastructure of the national oil sector.""",Pos
No One Knows Whats Next For Oil Demand.html,"The last two weeks saw three major energy organizations release their outlooks for the immediate future of oil demand. While sometimes these outlooks largely align in their projections on demand, this time, as sometimes happens, they diverged. The three organizations are OPEC, the International Energy Agency, and the U.S. Energy Information Administration. OPEC was first. The cartel released its latest Monthly Oil Market Report last week, expecting a mild effect of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus on oil demand and therefore leaving its demand projections for this year and next unchanged. This stands at a growth of 4.2 million bpd in 2022 from this year. The group cited “improved COVID-19 management and rising vaccination rates, enabling economic activity and mobility to return to pre-pandemic levels, supporting transportation fuels in particular,” as factors that would determine this growth in oil demand. Meanwhile, the International Energy Agency said in its own Oil Market Report that the Omicron variant would slow down demand growth, adding, however, that the effect would be temporary. The agency also revised slightly down its demand projections for 2021 and 2022, by 100,000 bpd, to a growth of, respectively, 5.4 million bpd this year and 3.3 million bpd next year.
  The difference between OPEC’s 4.5-million-bpd demand growth projection and the IEA’s 3.3 million bpd is quite understandable. OPEC has a vested interest in higher demand. The IEA, which has lately become more of a champion for the energy transition than an impartial energy agency, is skeptical about the future of oil demand. These biases are bound to affect calculations. The Energy Information Administration, however, served perhaps the biggest surprise in oil demand outlooks. In the latest edition of its Short-Term Energy Outlook, the authority forecast that next year, oil demand will increase by 3.4 million barrels daily. This was a downward revision of as many as 420,000 bpd from last month’s STEO projections. Despite the differences in exact expectations, the three organizations remain generally optimistic about oil demand, and this is perhaps what matters more than actual numbers, as appealing as these may be. “The surge in new Covid-19 cases is expected to temporarily slow, but not upend, the recovery in oil demand that is underway,” the IEA said in its OMR. “New containment measures put in place to halt the spread of the virus are likely to have a more muted impact on the economy versus previous Covid waves, not least because of widespread vaccination campaigns. As a result, we expect demand for road transport fuels and petrochemical feedstocks to continue to post healthy growth.” 
 The EIA, for its part, noted that “The potential effects of the spread of this variant are uncertain, which introduces downside risks to the global oil consumption forecast, particularly for jet fuel,” adding that “The Omicron variant has introduced additional uncertainty into oil markets for the coming months, and this uncertainty is reflected in the recent increase in oil price volatility.” And here’s OPEC’s comment on factors driving demand trends: “The expected market balance continues to be determined by the evolution of the COVID19 pandemic, as a key factor of uncertainty, but the successful joint efforts of the DoC continue to closely monitor all developments in a timely and vigilant manner, to be able to react to rapidly changing market circumstances.,” In other words, while on the face of the three agencies disagree about where oil demand is going, they are in complete unison about what will drive it: the pandemic. Maybe 2022 will be the last year the pandemic remains the single most important factor for oil demand as some medical experts—and JP Morgan—have suggested the Omicron variant is much milder than previous ones.",Neutral
China Draws From Stockpiles Again As Refiners Demand More Crude.html,"Driven by high refinery throughput, China likely drew crude oil from its commercial and strategic inventories in November, according to estimates from Reuters columnist Clyde Russell. Chinese crude imports rebounded last month compared to October, but official figures of November’s refinery runs showed that processing rates were higher than China’s total availability of crude from domestic production and imports. Therefore, the world’s largest oil importer likely drew crude from its reserves to the tune of 370,000 barrels per day (bpd) in November, according to estimates by Russell based on data for November China has disclosed. Chinese authorities do not report the volume of crude in its stockpiles, so its crude reserves, strategic and commercial, have always been the subject of speculation and guesstimates.
 In November, China drew crude oil from its stockpiles for the sixth time in the past eight months, Reuters’ Russell has estimated. Last month, Chinese crude imports jumped by 14.3 percent from October to average 10.17 million bpd in November. Imports plus domestic production combined averaged 14.14 million bpd. However, Chinese refiners processed 14.51 million bpd in November, up from 13.75 million bpd in October and up by 2.2 percent from November 2020, official data cited by Reuters showed on Wednesday. The difference between crude availability and higher processing rates could be explained with China drawing crude from its reserves, Russell notes.
 Between January and November, China is estimated to have added just 60,000 bpd to its crude stockpiles, either commercial or strategic. This is well below the massive building of crude reserves in recent years. The pace of China’s crude inventory builds could be a major driver of global oil demand and oil prices in the coming months. In the first quarter of 2022, China could see slowing crude imports. A combination of China’s policies to curb pollution in time for the Winter Olympics, its crackdown on illegal practices at independent refiners, and its zero-COVID policy with intermittent lockdowns are set to slow crude oil imports early next year, industry consultants have told Bloomberg.",Pos
Jet Fuel Continues To Hold Back Crude Demand Recovery.html,"Global demand for oil products other than jet fuel made a full recovery to pre-crisis levels in the third quarter of this year, thanks to the strong recovery of oil demand outside the aviation sector, data and analytics company GlobalData said on Thursday. Global demand for kerosene, primarily used for jet fuel, has been at around two-thirds of pre-COVID levels throughout this year. Including kerosene demand, total oil product demand was 3 percent below pre-COVID levels in the third quarter, GlobalData said. Strong Chinese demand for gasoline, naphtha, and LPG has led the global recovery in oil demand so far this year, according to the analytics firm.
 “Other major economies are still yet to see demand fully recover to pre-COVID-19 levels, but the strength of China’s growth plugs the gap. Still, the depressed aviation sector means a significant global demand shortfall, leaving open the prospect that we may have already seen peak oil demand — given the acceleration of energy transition to renewables,” said Will Scargill, Managing Energy Analyst at GlobalData.  Jet fuel demand was hit the worst since the start of the pandemic amid bans on international travel and quarantine requirements. Analysts have said that oil demand from the aviation sector will likely take until 2023 to fully recover to pre-COVID levels. Recent travel restrictions in the wake of the Omicron variant will likely stall the recovery in jet fuel demand in the fourth quarter of this year, according to GlobalData.
 Despite the lagging recovery of aviation fuel demand, major forecasters expect total annual global oil demand to reach pre-crisis levels next year. Although the International Energy Agency revised down by 100,000 bpd its oil demand growth forecasts for this year and next earlier this week, the IEA expects oil demand to rise by 5.4 million bpd compared to 2020, and another 3.3 million bpd in 2022, reaching the pre-COVID levels of 99.5 million bpd. OPEC also sees total oil demand back to pre-crisis levels in 2022, expecting a “mild and short-lived” impact of Omicron on overall consumption.",Neg
